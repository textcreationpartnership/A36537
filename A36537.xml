            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>N Holy Man ſtiles Death very ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantly, <hi>The King of Terrors;</hi> that is to ſay, The moſt terrible of all other things: for there is nothing that we can imagine in the world more dreadful and more odious than Death. It is poſſible to decline the edge of drawn ſwords, to cloſe the Lyons jaws, to quench the Fires fury; but when Death ſhoots its poiſoned Arrows, when it opens its Infernal Jaws
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:41646:5"/>and when it ſends forth its Devouring Flames, it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together impoſſible to ſecure our ſelves; impoſſible it is to prevent or decline its mercileſs fury. There is an infinite number of Warlike inventions, by which we commonly defeat the evil deſignes of the moſt power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and dreadful Enemies, but there is no ſtratagem of the moſt Renowned General, no Fortification never ſo Regular and Artificial, nor Army never ſo victori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, that can retard but for a moment, the approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of Death, this laſt Enemy. In the twinkling of an eye it flies through the ſtrongeſt Bulwarks, the deepeſt Walls, and the moſt prodigious Towns. It leaps over the largeſt Ditches, the moſt prodigious Caſtles, and the moſt inacceſſable Rocks. It blows down the ſtrongeſt Barricadoes, and laughs at all our military Trenches, every where it finds the weakneſs of our Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, and through the beſt temper'd Breaſtplates it ſtrikes the proudeſt Hearts. In the darkeſt Dungeons it finds us out, and ſnatcheth us out of the hands of our moſt Truſty and Watchful Guards. In a word, Nature and Art can furniſh us with nothing that is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to protect us from Deaths cruel and inſatiable hands.</p>
            <p>There is no man ſo barbarous, but ſuffers himſelf to be overcome ſometimes by the Prayers and Tears of ſuch as caſt themſelves at his feet to implore his Mercy; Nay ſuch as have loſt all ſence of Humanity and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, do commonly ſpare in their rage, the weakeſt Age and Sex. But unmerciful Death hath no more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of ſuch as humble themſelves to her, as of others that reſiſt her Power. It takes no notice of Infants Tears, and cries, It plucks them from the Breaſts of their tender hearted Mothers, and cruſhes them in piec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es before their Eies. It ſcorns the Lamentations of dainty Dames, and delights to trample upon their moſt raviſhing Beauties. It ſtops its ears to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts of trembling old Age, and caſts to the ground the Gray Heads, as ſo many withered Oaks.</p>
            <pb n="3" facs="tcp:41646:5"/>
            <p>At a Battel when Princes and Generals of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies Army, are taken priſoners, they are not Treated as the common Soldiers: but unmerciful Death treads under feet as audaciouſly, the Subject as the Prince, the Servant and the Maſter, the Noble and the Vaſſal, the begging <hi>Lazarus</hi> and the rich <hi>Abraham</hi> together. It blows out with the ſame blaſt, the moſt glorious Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minaries, and the moſt loathſome Lamps. It hath no more reſpects for the Crowns of Kings, the Popes Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and the Cardinals Caps, than for the Shepheards Crook, or the Slaves Chains; It heaps them all together, ſhuts them in the ſame Dungeon, and in the ſame Mortar it pounds them all to powder.</p>
            <p>There is no War never ſo furious and bloudy, but is interrupted with ſome days, or at leaſt ſome hours of Ceſſation and Truce: Nay, the moſt inhumane minds are at laſt tired with their bloody Conqueſts, but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatiable Death never ſaith it is enough: At every hour and moment it cuts down whole Nations and Kindreds; the Fleſh of all the Animals that have lived and died ſince the Creation of the World, hath not been able to glut this horrid Monſter.</p>
            <p>All warfare is doubtful, he that wins the Victory to day, may ſoon after be put to flight. He that rides at preſent in a Triumphing Chariot, may become the footſtool of his Enemy; but Death is always victori<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ous, it triumphs with an inſufferable inſolency over all the Kings and Nations of the Earth; it never returns to its Den but loaden with ſpoils and full of Blood. The ſtrongeſt <hi>Sampſons</hi> and the moſt victorious <hi>Davids</hi> who have torn in pieces and overcome Lions, Bears, and cut off the Heads of Giants, have at laſt themſelves yielded, and been cut off by Death. The Great <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anders,</hi> and the Triumphing <hi>Caeſars,</hi> that have made all the World to tremble before them, and conquered the moſt part of the habitable Earth, could never find any thing that might protect them from Deaths power;
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:41646:6"/>when glorious Statues and ſtately Trophies were rais'd to their Honor, Death did laugh at their Vanity, and make ſport with their Perſons. The rich Marbles, where ſo many proud Titles are Engraven, cover no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a little rotten Fleſh and a few Bones, which Death hath broken and reduc'd to Aſhes.</p>
            <p>We read in the Revelations of the Prophet <hi>Daniel,</hi> That King <hi>Nebuchadnezar</hi> ſaw in a Dream a large Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of Gold, both Glorious and Terrible; <hi>Its head was of pure Gold, its Breaſt and Arms were of Silver, its bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and thighs of Braſs, its Legs of Iron, and its Feet were partly of Clay and partly of Iron.</hi> As the Prince was beholding it, with aſtoniſhment, a little Stone cut out of a Mountain, without hands, was roll'd againſt the feet of this prodigious Statue, and broke it all to pieces; not only the Clay and the Iron were broken, but alſo the Gold, the Silver, and the Braſs; all became as the chaffe which the wind blows to and fro: This great Image repreſents the four Univerſal Monarchies of the World; That of <hi>Babylon,</hi> that of the <hi>Perſians</hi> and <hi>Medes,</hi> that of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and that of the <hi>Romans;</hi> It repreſents alſo the Vanity and unconſtancy of all things under the Sun; for what is the Pomp, the Glory, the Strength and Dignities of this World, but a ſmoak that the wind drives before it, and a vapor that ſoon, vaniſhes away; All is like a ſhadow that flies from us, or like a Dream that diſappears in an inſtant; when crazy Man that was created in the Image of God, riſeth out of the Duſt, he ſeems to be very glorious for awhile, and becomes terrible, but aſſoon as Death ſtrikes at his Earthly part, and begins to break his Fleſh and Bones; all the Glory, Pomp, Power, and Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence of the richeſt, of the moſt terrible and victori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Monarchs are chang'd into a loathſome Smell, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to contemptible Duſt, and reduc'd to nothing; <hi>Vanity of vanities all is vanity.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="5" facs="tcp:41646:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p>Seeing therefore that Deaths cruelty is ſo notable, that it ſpares none, and that its power is ſo great, that none can eſcape or reſiſt it; It is no wonder if Death is become ſo terrible, and fills with fears, grief and deſpair, the minds of all Mortals, who have not ſetled their Faith and Aſſurance upon God; for there is no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned priſoner but trembles when he beholds the Scaffold erecting, upon which he is deſigned to be broken upon a Wheel, or when he ſpies in the fire the Irons with which he is to be pincht to death. In the midſt of a ſumptuous Feaſt, King <hi>Belſhaſar</hi> ſaw the fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of a Mans hand writing theſe words upon his wall of the Palace, <hi>Mene, Mene, Tekel <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pharſin,</hi> which the Prophet <hi>Daniel</hi> hath thus interpreted: <hi>Mene, God hath numbred thy Kingdom, and finiſhed it; Tekel, Thou art weighed in the balances and art found wanting; Perez</hi> or <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pharſin, Thy kingdom is divided and given to the Medes and Perſians;</hi> As ſoon as this Great Monarch had caſt his eyes upon this miraculous writing, it is ſaid that his countenance was changed, and his thoughts trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled him, ſo that the joynts of his Loyns were looſed, and his Knees ſmote one againſt another. Certainly; the profound Worldling hath a greater cauſe to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayed in the midſt of his Glory and Pleaſures, when he may perceive Death writing upon every wall of his Houſe in viſible Characters, and printing upon his Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, that <hi>God hath numbred his days,</hi> and this in which he now breaths, ſhall be ſoon followed by an eternal night; That God hath weighed him in the ballance of his Juſtice, and found him lighter than the Wind; And that the terrible Creator, unto whom vengeance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs, will ſoon diveſt him of all his Glory and Riches, to cloath therewith his Enemies; what comforts can be found by the wretched ſinners, who do not only under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the particulars of their final ſentence, but do alſo hear the thundring noiſe of the Great Judge of the world, offended at their impieties; They may now
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:41646:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>perceive Hell prepared to ſwallow them up, and the fiery Chains of that doleful priſon ready to receive them; They may at preſent feel the hands of the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioner of Gods juſtice, that ſeizeth upon them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, and ſee themſelves before ſtretcht and tortur'd in that place, where there ſhall be nothing but weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and horrible gnaſhing of Teeth: at preſent they feel the fierceneſs of that fire and brimſtone, for it may juſtly be ſaid of theſe wretched Varlots, <hi>That Hell comes to them before they go to Hel;</hi> and that in this life they are tormented with the grievous pangs of the ſecond Death; therefore ſome of them in deſpair, do offer violence to themſelves, and commit an horrid murder upon their own perſons, as if they were afraid not to dye by a hand wicked enough: the expectation of Death to them, is more inſufferable than Death it ſelf, and they had rather caſt themſelves into the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomleſs pit of Hell, than endure the apprehenſions and fears of Hell in their guilty Conſciences, to be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered of the flaſhes of Hell-fire, that mounts up to their ſouls in this life, they caſt themſelves in a brutiſh manner into that unquenchable Burning.</p>
            <p>That which is moſt terrible is, that the horrid and unſufferable fears that ſeize upon the wicked, are not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for a moment; for as a Criminal that knows that there is a ſentence of Doom pronounced againſt him, doth continually fancy and think upon thoſe torments that are preparing for him; aſſoon as he hears the door unlocking, or a Fly buſſing about his ears, he imagines that ſome are entring to drag him from his priſon to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution; in ſome ſenſe he deſires what he apprehends, and haſtens the approaches of that, for which he wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, and cannot avoid. Thus deſperate ſinners that know there is a ſentence of eternal Death pronounced againſt them in the Court of the King of Kings, and that from this Sentence there is no Appeal nor Eſcape, muſt needs be in continual fears. Such foreſee the fearful
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:41646:7"/>image of Death, that diſturbs their quiet, and as <hi>St. Paul</hi> expreſſeth himſelf. <hi>Through fear of death they are all their life-time ſubject to bondage,</hi> Heb. 2. That is, They are like ſo many wretched Slaves that daily trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble under the inhumane power of a mercileſs Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant.</p>
            <p>I am not ignorant that there be ſome Atheiſts who talk of Death, with contempt and ſcorn, and who make an open profeſſion of braving Death without the leaſt ſence of fear; nevertheleſs they feel in their ſouls ſome ſecret Thorns, with which death doth often gaul them; ſome fears and apprehenſions with which it tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and diſquiets them when they dream leaſt of her. It is true, they do for the moſt part boaſt of not fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the approaches of Death, and laugh at it when they imagine that ſhe is at a diſtance from them, but theſe are they who are moſt apt to tremble at the grim coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of Death; and ſooneſt to diſcover their weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and deſpair.</p>
            <p>If there be any that ſeem to laugh at Death, their laughter is only in appearance upon the Lips; they are like a Child newly born, that ſeems to laugh when he is inwardly tormented in its Bowels, or like thoſe that have eaten of the famous Herb, mentioned by the Herbaliſts, that cauſeth a pleaſant laughter to appear upon the Lips of ſuch, into whoſe noble parts it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veys a mortal poiſon, to bring them to an inevitable end.</p>
            <p>There be ſome, I confeſs then, die without expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing any fear or dread of Conſcience; but theſe are either bruitiſh or ſenſleſs Perſons, much like unto a ſleeping Drunkard, who may be caſt down a Tower without any knowledge or foreſight of the danger; or they be pleaſant mockers who are like the fooliſh Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minals that go merrily to the Gallows; or they be ſuch as are full of Rage and Fury, whom I may very well compare to an enraged wild Bear, that runs himſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>e of them laugh ingeniouſly at our miſeries, others do art ficially weep to behold them; but in all their Writings, and tragick Expreſſions, we cannot find any ſolid and ſincere Comforts, to ſtrengthen us againſt the apprehenſions of Death; therefore their contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible and vain fancies oblige us to tell them, as <hi>Job</hi> did to his friends, who did diſquiet inſtead of comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, <hi>Your remembrances are like unto aſhes, your bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies to bodies of Clay,</hi> Job, 13. It is true, ſome of theſe Learned Philoſophers have very well ſpoken, that we begin to dye, aſſoon as we begin to breath, and that our Life is like unto a Candle that lives by its ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:41646:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>unto death, whereof the Flame doth devour and conſume it; for the natural heat that entertains our life, doth inſenſibly undermine it, for it is that which ſpends our radical moiſture or humidity, that yields the ſame benefits unto our life, as Oyl doth to a Lamp, or Wax to a Taper.</p>
            <p>Others have aſwel ſaid, that our preſent life is but a ſwift Race from one Mother to another; they meant from the Womb of our Mothers that brought us into the world, into the womb and boſom of the Earth, that will receive us at laſt; for aſſoon as we are born, we run a ſwift Race towards our Grave: at that inſtant when we fly from death, we do draw inſenſibly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it, and contrary to any intention, we caſt our ſelves into its Boſom and Arms. Some of the ſame School have compared Man to a bubble upon Water, that riſes and ſwells, and immediately decreaſes and breaks; others make him like to the wateriſh bottles, of divers colours, that Children cauſe with their breath, and deſtroy with the ſame. In truth, all Mans Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is but a vain appearance that vaniſhes away in an inſtant; Iſai. 40. <hi>All fleſh is like graſs, and all the glory of man like the Flowers of the Field,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.</p>
            <p>One of theſe great Philoſophers being demanded what the life of man was, anſwered never a word, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſuch a queſtion deſerved no anſwer, or rather becauſe he would imitate the cuſtom of his Age, of ſpeaking by gueſs, and ſymbolick repreſentations; for that purpoſe he entred into a Chamber, and paſt out of it again at the ſame inſtant. This he did to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs unto his Diſciples that queſtioned him; how that Mans Life is but an entrance in, and egreſs out of the World, the one ſucceeds immediately the other.</p>
            <p>Another of the ſame Sect walkt in a bravado two or three turns, and then ſhrunk into a Pit, to ſignify, That our Life is but a kind of Maſcarade, a vain ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance that ſoon vaniſhes; when Men have well
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:41646:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>admired themſelves and their Beauty, and when they have drawn the looks and eſteem of the World, Death ſnatches them away, daſhes out all their Beauty, and ſwallows their borrowed Glory in a mournful Grave. It is with us as with Actors in a Comedy, the one repreſents a King, the other an Emperor, the one a Counſellor, the other a Miniſter of State, but when the Comedy is ended and the Garments changed, you know not which is which; we are like Counters up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Table, ſome ſignify Unites, others Tens, others Hundreds, and others Thouſands, and Millions, but when they are gathered together, and put again into the Purſe, this vaſt difference appears no more; This is a lively Image of all mankind, for in this life ſome appear upon the Throne, others are ſeated upon a Dunghil, ſome flouriſh in Golden and Silken attire; others are cloathed with nakedneſs; ſome Command as Princes, others ſubmit as Gally-ſlaves; ſome are fed with exquiſite Dainties, others muſt be content with the Bread of affliction: but when Death hath caſt them all into their Graves together, then they appear equal and alike.</p>
            <p>All theſe witty expreſſions and others of the like nature, are pleaſant and true, they teach well, and flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the fancy, but they afford no real Comforts; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to all theſe Learned Doctors, we may ſay as <hi>Job</hi> by way of reproach to his friends that did add ſorrow to his affliction. <hi>You are all Phyſitians of no value, How then comfort ye me in vain?</hi> Job 13.9. and 21.34.</p>
            <p>When a poor Patient is ſtretched with the Tortures of an unmerciful Gout, or of the Stone in his Kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys, that forceth from him at every moment, moſt grievous ſighs and groans; If any ſhould offer to paint before him his looks, and grimneſs, or that ſhould coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit them ingeniouſly, in his preſence, he would bring him little eaſe to his torments, rather an increaſe to his vexation and trouble: The moſt beautiful Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:41646:9"/>alſo can give no delight to ſuch as are rackt in the Executioners hands, or tied to four Horſes, that are ready to tear him in pieces. Thus it is with the moſt eloquent and florid Diſcourſe, it can bring no comfort to a ſoul that is departing. <hi>Davids</hi> Harp alone can drive away the evil ſpirits, and appeaſe the troubles of a wounded Conſcience.</p>
            <p>But ſome may imagine in this general ſurvey of the wiſe Follies and Vanity of the Heathen Philoſophers, I ſhould except the Stoicks; I confeſs that in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular they expreſs more gravity, but they proceeded no better; nay, when I have well conſidered them, I find them to be far more unſufferable, and more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent than the reſt; for beſides that, they treat of the immortality of the ſoul, in a very doubtful and unconſtant manne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, the pretended comforts that they offer, do render Death more dreadful.</p>
            <p>They tell us, that Death is the end and center where all humane Afflictions and Miſeries ceaſe, therefore it is rather to be deſired, than avoided or feared. They might have ſome colourable reaſon for this concluſion, if they did but diſcover beyond the Grave, an happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which they might here expect and hope for. Death aſſures them of no other comfort, but only to put a period to all the miſeries of this wretched life. Therefore ſuch kind of Diſcourſes are not properly Comforts, and the reſolution that they beget in us, is but a ſilly Paſſion, much like unto a Criminal upon the Rack, who impatiently longs for Death, that he might be delivered from the cruel hands of the Executioners, or who bears the inferior torments with joy, to get on the top of the Scaffold where he is to be broken up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Wheel; Oh miſerable wretch! the change of Tortures will bring no eaſe to thy Pains, if thou canſt not endure patiently the Ropes that unjoynt thy Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, how wilt thou ſuffer the bar of Iron that ſhall crack all thy bones in pieces. O blind Philoſopher!
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:41646:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>If thou canſt not bear the miſeries of this life, how wilt thou endure the pains and tortures of Death.</p>
            <p>Moreover, they tell us, That the moſt cruel and pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Death is a noble occaſion to exerciſe our vertue, and to cauſe our conſtancy and reſolution to appear with admiration. This diſcourſe ſeems to be plauſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but in reality it is nothing but wind, for what availeth this apparent vertue, becauſe it doth not ſtop us from falling into the deepeſt Abyſs of Torments and Miſery, but it periſheth, and dies with its Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. Therefore, ſuch as have moſt admired it, have at laſt acknowledged its vanity, witneſs that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous and worthy General, who fancied, that his vertue would procure unto him the Victory over all the Enemies of the Roman Common-wealth, for whoſe ſake he took up Arms; when the Battle was loſt, and all his ambitious hopes had deceived him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ready to ſtab himſelf with his own ſword; he cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out, <hi>Oh miſerable Vertue what art thou but a vain and an unprofitable word, a name without a body.</hi> He did thus exclaim againſt his Vertue that he had formerly adored, becauſe it could yield him no comfort in the day of his diſtreſs, nor free him from falling into utter diſpair.</p>
            <p>The moſt ordinary and uſual comforts that they commonly bring, are theſe; That Death is inevita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that we all enter into the world upon condition to go out; that we have as much cauſe to be afflicted with the day of our Birth, as with the day of our Death; That Humanity and Immortality are not conſiſtant; That Death is a Tribute we all owe to Nature; That the Kings, and greateſt Monarchs are forced to pay it, as well as the meaneſt Subjects; and that this is ſuch an univerſal Law, that it admits of no exception.</p>
            <p>But theſe kind of Comforts do but increaſe our trouble, and add to our affliction, I have therefore good reaſon to ſpeak unto theſe grave Philoſophers <hi>Job</hi>'s
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:41646:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>language to his troubleſome friends, <hi>Miſerable Comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers are ye all.</hi> For in truth, they don't only ſearch the wound to the quick, without any application of an healing Plaiſter, but they alſo tear and widen it, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame and render it far more grievous; when we are in hopes of ſeeing an end to our calamities, our ſoul is comforted and armes it ſelf with conſtancy, and a patient reſolution; but when we ſee our ſelves caſt into an Abyſſe of Evil, and that no hopes appear of getting out, we are then overwhelmed with grief and deſpair; It is a lamentable thing to be born to dye, but it is far more lamentable and grievous, to know that Death is not to be avoided; that all the Treaſures of the world cannot free us from it, for his afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is the greateſt, whoſe miſery can never be cur'd.</p>
            <p>This alſo is a falſe and deceitful maxime, That the comfort of the miſerable is to have companions in mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, although many thouſand drink together of the waters of <hi>Marah,</hi> they ſeem no leſs bitter; and although thou ſhouldeſt be burnt in a fire where many are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed, thou ſhalt not find there a milder and a more eaſy abode. Thy neighbors grief doth not leſſen thy Affliction, their Sickneſs cannot reſtore to thee Health, and their Death comfort thee againſt the approaches of thine own. On the contrary, if thou haſt any ſence of Humanity, thou wilt weep for their Miſery, and thine together: It is that which great <hi>Xerxes,</hi> King of <hi>Perſia,</hi> did practice; for when he took a view of his numerous Army, in which there were 1100000 Men, and conſidered, that within one hundred years, ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny brave Captains and Soldiers would be rotting in their Graves, he was moved with compaſſion and wept. I do not mention here the brutiſh and fooliſh opinion of ſuch as imagine, that Mans Soul is mortal, and dies with our Bodies. This conſideration brings no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, but caſts us into an irrecoverable deſpair; for af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the torments of Hell fire, there is nothing that can
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:41646:11"/>be imagined more dreadful, than a reducement to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
            <p>It is needleſs alſo to mention the Philoſophers that are Diſciples of <hi>Plato,</hi> who have diſcourſed of the Souls Immutability, and of its Bleſſedneſs after this life: they imagine themſelves very acute and ſubtle, but their diſcourſes of this matter, are ſo groſs and extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant, that inſtead of perſwading the Truth they expreſs it to ſcorn and contempt Let their fond and imaginary deſcriptions of the <hi>Elyſian</hi> Fields, be witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes for whatſoever they have invented of this kind, hath been placed amongſt the Fables and poetical Ficti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Thoſe Chymerical Gardens under ground, contain nothing like to the Divine Excellencies, and unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able pleaſures of the Paradiſe of God.</p>
            <p>In one word, ſeek amongſt the rareſt and moſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Treaſuries of Wit and Learning, belonging to the Heathen Antiquity; turn over the Writings of the moſt Eloquent Orators, of the Subtleſt Philoſophers, of the moſt famous Poets; examine the Secrets of the moſt expert and experienced Phyſitians, conſider their Practice, and all the Remedies that they preſcribe to the Soul, and you ſhall find them too unskilful to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the leaſt Cure; They do but charm and divert the Diſeaſe, hardens us againſt the evil; they fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh us with a good exterior, and teach us to bear a good Meen, but they have no real Antidote againſt the Venome that kills the Principle of Life, nor Remedy that reaches to the Heart. And as the Torrents that dry up in the hotteſt ſeaſons, ſuch Conſolations that flow not from the Fountain of Life, vaniſh away with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out effect, and dry up to nothing, when a deep ſorrow, fear, and affliction, ſeize upon a ſinful Soul.</p>
            <p>It ſeems, the contrivers of the Heathens Religion, were ſenſible of this Truth, for they have dedicated Temples, and erected Altars to all manner of gods, and goddeſſes; not only to Vertues and Health, but
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:41646:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>alſo to Vices and Diſeaſes, to Fear, Cowardiſe, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, the Feavor, the Peſtilence, and an infinite more, but they left Death out of their Devotions. This is an open Declaration, that they knew not how to ſtrike acquaintance with Death, and win its eſteem and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor. They had no Sacrifices nor Incenſe that could al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay its fury; they lookt upon it as their moſt inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane and unreconcileable Enemy. The very name of Death did terrify them, therefore it was one of their moſt unfortunate Omens. <hi>Adrian</hi> the Emperor is a witneſs of what I ſay; he was one of the greateſt Princes in former Ages, he had made moſt part of the habitable World tremble under his Scepter, and put to death an infinite number of Men; but at laſt he trembled, and was aſtoniſhed himſelf at the approaches of Death; he had overcome the moſt barbarous Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and tam'd the moſt ſavage Beaſts; but when he came to this laſt Enemy, he had no weapons fit for the Encounter; therefore in this occaſion he diſcovers the weakneſs and unconſtancy of his Mind, far more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb'd, than his Body was with the Diſeaſe. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he did employ the Magick Art, to retard Death, ſometimes he did make uſe of his Sword and Poiſon, to haſten it, at laſt he kill'd himſelf by an abſtinence from Food, neceſſary to entertain his life. He had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer'd all the World, and given Peace and Happineſs to his Empire, but he could not overcome himſelf, or appeaſe the troubles of his Conſcience: he was ſo far from ſatisfying the troubleſome thoughts of his Soul, that he ſuffers himſelf to be overwhelmed with deſpair; he flatters his Soul in haſtening its ruine, for when his Diſeaſe did ſuffer him to breath, he talkt unto it in this manner; <hi>My little Soul, my deareſt Companion, Thou art now going to wander in obſcure Cold, and ſtrange places; Thou ſhalt never jeſt again according to the wont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed cuſtom; thou ſhalt never give me any ſport or pleaſure any more.</hi>

            <pb n="16" facs="tcp:41646:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p>But ſome may ſay that <hi>Adrian</hi> was a powerful Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch, but no great Philoſopher; that he knew how to Govern, and was well acquainted with the Politicks; but that he was ignorant of the Morals, and had no skill to dye well. To anſwer this Objection, let us give an example of one without exception, who will ſatisfy all Opponents.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> is generally eſteem'd to have been the Subtleſt, and the moſt Learned of the Heathen Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, he was the Prince of all the Philoſophers, the Glory of his Age, and the Founder of his Sect; when his excellent Soul had viewed all things, examined the Heavens, ſearcht among the excellencies of the Earth, pryed into all the Wonders of the World, and found out the rareſt Secrets of Nature; He could never find any ſolid Comforts againſt the apprehenſions of Death. Notwithſtanding all his admirable Subtleties, and his profound Learning, the fears of this cruel Death ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifies his Conſcience in ſuch a manner, that he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed, <hi>That of all terrible things, Death was the moſt dreadful.</hi>

            <p>WHen <hi>David</hi> had a deſign to fight with <hi>Goliah,</hi> he could not make uſe of the Armor of King <hi>Saul,</hi> therefore he took a ſmooth ſtone out of his Bag, caſt it with his Sling, ſtruck the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtine</hi> in the Forehead, and brought down this proud Giant, who had defied the Armies of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> We have already examined, and tried all the Armor of humane Wiſdom and Learning, laid up in the Storehouſes of
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:41646:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>the greateſt wits of former Ages, and we have found that they are not able to yield us any benefit, when we ſhall encounter with Death. Let us therefore now ſee whither we may overcome this Proud Enemy, with the Sling of our myſtical <hi>David,</hi> with the weapons of our Divine Shepheard; but before we begin the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter, let us look and behold it in the face. The enemy that I intend that you ſhould overcome, is a Monſter with three Heads, for there are three ſorts of death, the Corporal, the Spiritual, and the Eternal.</p>
            <p>The Corporal Death is a ſeparation of the Soul from the Body; although our Body hath been faſhioned with the Finger of God, it is but a weak and frail Veſſel made with the ſlime of the Earth; but our Soul is of an Heavenly, Spiritual, and Immortal Subſtance; it is a Sparkle and a Raie of the Godhead, and the lively Image of our great Creator; for when God had made our firſt Parent, <hi>He breathed into his Noſtrils the breath of Life, Gen.</hi> 2.7. that we might thereby underſtand, that our Souls do proceed from his immediate hand, therefore he is named the <hi>Father of ſpirits,</hi> Heb. 12. and <hi>The faithful Creator of Souls,</hi> 1 Pet. 4. This Soul doth raiſe us a degree above all the Animals, and above the Celeſtial Bodies and renders us like to the Angels of Heaven: It is the Light that enlightens us, the Salt that preſerves us from Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption; In one word, by this Soul we live, enjoy our Sences, move, and underſtand; as ſoon as this Angelical Gueſt leaves its Lodging and Earthly abode, it looſeth all Beauty, and falls of it ſelf into an inevitable ruine: For this Fleſh that we entertain with care, and pamper with all manner of Dainties, doth then corrupt and rot; after that, it hath been ſtretcht awhile upon Beds of Gold, and richly attired in Purple and Scarlet, it is caſt upon a Bed of Worms, and covered with the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt inſects of the Earth; notwithſtanding all its former perfumes, it yields then a moſt horrid ſtink; before it
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:41646:13"/>did raviſh the eyes of the Beholders with its admirable Beauty, but now it becomes ſo odious and horrible, that the living care not to ſee it; at laſt it is reduc'd to aſhes, according to the Sentence that was pronounc'd in the Earthly Paradiſe, <hi>Duſt thou art, and to Duſt thou ſhalt return.</hi> The Spiritual Death is the ſeparation of the Soul from God our Creator, for he being the Soul of our Souls, and the Light of our Life; aſſoon as we depart from this ſource of Light and Life, we fall into an Abyſſe of Darkneſs and Death, <hi>For all thoſe that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from God ſhall periſh,</hi> Pſal. 73. As the Members when they are cut off from the Body, do commonly rot, and as the Twig withers when it is ſeparated from the Vine, ſo in a ſeparation from God, we can neither live, move, nor have a Being; and as it is with the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſeparated from the Soul, it nouriſheth a neſt of Worms that devour it, and ſends forth a moſt inſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſtench: ſo it is with our Soul, when it is at a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from God, it brings forth a multitude of evil affections, that torment and conſume it, and the ill ſcent of its crimes are odious to Heaven and Earth; of this kind of death our Saviour ſpeaks to the Jews in this manner; <hi>If you do not believe that I am he, you ſhall dye in your ſins,</hi> John 8. And to the Angel of the Church of <hi>Sardis, Thou haſt a name that thou liveſt and art dead,</hi> Rev. 3. This ſame Death <hi>St. Paul</hi> mentions in the 2 Chap. of the <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> and 2 of the <hi>Epheſ. When you were dead in your treſpaſſes and ſins, God hath quickened us together with Chriſt,</hi> and elſewhere he exhorts a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full man, <hi>Awake thou that ſleepeſt, and ariſe from the dead and Chriſt ſhall give thee Light,</hi> Eph. 5. And it is of the ſame kind of Death that <hi>St. Paul</hi> ſpeaks of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Lecherous Widow, that <hi>She is dead while ſhe liveth,</hi> 1 Tim. 5.</p>
            <p>It was this kind of Death that <hi>Adam</hi> ſuffered aſſoon as he had taſted of the forbidden Fruit, according to Gods threatening; <hi>In the day that thou eateſt thereof,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:41646:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>thou ſhalt dye the death:</hi> For not only his body became ſubject to Death and Corruption, but his Soul alſo was caſt into the death of Sin, and enſlaved to corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. It happened to him as to a Lamp newly put out, the ſnuff yields a moſt ill-favour'd ſcent.</p>
            <p>As the life of Grace is a preparation to the life of Glory, as it furniſheth us with a fore-taſt of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly joys; ſo on the contrary, the Spiritual Life is, as it were, the Suburbs of Hell; it is the firſt begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of an Eternal death, and the mouth of the infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Pit. The Eternal Death is nothing elſe but an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire and irrecoverable ſeparation of the Soul and Body from God, accompanied with infinite Torments; Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments indeed, unto which all the ſufferings of this mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal life are but light and inconſiderable ſcratches; never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs as the ſpirit of God doth repreſent the Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly joys and felicities by the things that are moſt plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant and delightful; thus to expreſs unto us Hells Torments, it borrows the things that are the moſt dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and painful in this life. We are told of an <hi>Abyſſe,</hi> or <hi>Furnace full of flames, a bottomleſs pit, burning with fire and brimſtone.</hi> The Scripture mentions, <hi>Chaines of darkneſs;</hi> an <hi>Eternal night,</hi> and an <hi>Hell fire, where there are weeping and knaſhing of Teeth; it tels us that</hi> Tophet <hi>is ordained of old, yea for the King it is prepared, he hath made it deep and large, the pile thereof is fire and much wood, the breath of the Lord like a ſtream of Brimſtone doth kindle it.</hi> Iſai. 30.33.</p>
            <p>Fancy to your ſelves a Man devoured with Worms, burning in hot Flames, who is broken and tortured con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually, in whoſe wounds kindled Brimſtone is pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed without intermiſſion, with boyling Lead and burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Pitch, and if there be any other Torment more grievous and horrid, fancy it alſo; All this will give us but a light, and an imperfect image of Hell torments, for all the pangs of the Body are nothing in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:41646:14"/>to the horrors, troubles, and incredible griefs that ſhall, for ever, rack and torture the damned Souls in Hell.</p>
            <p>As ſname doth aggravate our ſufferings, and render them more terrible, the damned ſhall be loaden with Shame and Infamy for all Eternity, their names ſhall be hateful to God, and his Holy Angels and they, ſhall be curſed with an endleſs Curſe. And as it is an increaſe to our Torment to ſuffer in the company of abominable Varlets, and to become a companion of the moſt infamons Executioner; they ſhall ſuffer with Hells Executioner, and ſhall be ſent to the fire prepared for the Devil and his Angels: All their ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes ſhall ſhare in theſe horrid Torments, they ſhall be cruſht in the <hi>Wine-preſs</hi> of Gods Eternal Wrath, and they ſhall feel for ever and ever, the ſtroaks of Gods ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance, and of his Almighty hand; They ſhall then learn by experience what a terrible thing it is to fall into the hands of the living God, and how unſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able that fire is that ſhall conſume his Enemies; their Eyes ſhall perceive nothing but the bottomleſs pit, the Devils image, and the Furies of Hell: their Ears ſhall hear nothing but the horrible outcries and fearful roar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Tormented Devils, and damn'd ſouls. They ſhall be choakt with the noiſome ſmell and fumes of the bottomleſs pit; they ſhall then drink the very Dregs and the bottom of Gods anger and indignation, and they ſhall ſuck the venom of his Arrows, <hi>Fire and Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone ſhall be the portion of their Cup.</hi> Pſal. 11.</p>
            <p>The ſufferings of this life are but ſhort, and for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but the Torments of the damned ſhall never end, <hi>Their Worm dieth not, and their fire ſhall never be quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> Mar. 9. Revel. 20. They ſhall be tormented day and night for all Eternity; when they ſhall have ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd as many thouſand Ages as there be drops of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the Sea, or grains of Sand on the ſhore; it ſhall
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:41646:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>be but the beginning of their grief; they ſhall live for ever to dye continually, and they ſhall dye and never be conſum'd; in the midſt of thoſe hot flames, they ſhall beg a drop of water to cool their tongue, <hi>Luk.</hi> 16. but we may ſay of this Fire that ſhall torture the damn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, what the Spouſe in the <hi>Canticles</hi> ſaith of the Divine love that had enflamed her Soul, <hi>Many waters cannot quench it, neither can the flouds drown it,</hi> Cant. 8. And <hi>St. Paul</hi> tels us, that <hi>the things that God hath prepared for them that love him; eye hath not ſeen, ear hath not heard, nor did it ever enter into the heart of man,</hi> 1 Cor. 2. So on the contrary we may ſay, that thoſe things that God hath prepared for them that hate him, <hi>Eye hath not ſeen, Ear hath not heard, nor did never enter into the Heart of man.</hi> From hence ſhall proceed their Rage, Madneſs, and deſpair; they ſhall cry in <hi>Cains</hi> Language, <hi>My puniſhment is greater then I can bear,</hi> Gen. 4. when they ſhall ſee nothing but an extream miſery, and woful darkneſs, they will curſe God the King of all Creatures, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 8. In their fury and rage they will eat their Tongues, and blaſpheme the great God of Heaven and Earth. It had been far better for ſuch perſons, that they had never been born, therefore they ſhall ſeek death and ſhall not find it, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. They ſhall deſire to dye, that is, to be reduc'd to nothing, <hi>Revel.</hi> 9. but this death ſhall fly from them, who of you <hi>can dwell in everlaſting burning?</hi> Iſ. 33. who of us can dwell in Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Flames? <hi>Revel.</hi> 6. If the viols, and little cups full of Gods wrath, do force the wicked to cry out, how much more ſhall the Rivers and the Ocean of Gods venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance force from them; <hi>O mountains fall upon us, O rocks cover us, and hide us from the face of him that ſits upon the Throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb, for the day of his anger is come, and who may abide it?</hi> Prov. 1. But as they have ſtopt their ears to Gods gracious calls, and hardned their hearts to his invitations to repentance, then God ſhall alſo ſtop his ears to their outcries, and
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:41646:15" rendition="simple:additions"/>his eyes to their horrid ſufferings, and when they ſhall be overwhelmed with fear and deſpair, God will ſcorn and mock at their inſufferable miſery.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>That Jeſus Chriſt our Lord hath redeemed us from Eternal Death, and by degrees doth deliver us from a ſpiritual Death.</hi>
               </p>
            </argument>
            <p>WE read in the fifth Chapter of the Revelation of <hi>S. John,</hi> That this beloved Diſciple wept bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly, becauſe no being in Heaven and Earth, nor under the Earth, was able to open the Book, ſealed with ſeven Seals, that was in Gods right hand; at that inſtant, one of the 24 Elders ſpake to him, <hi>Weep not, behold the Lion of the Tribe of Juda hath overcome to open the Book and to looſe the ſeven Seals.</hi> Thus we have until now wept bitterly, becauſe we could find no body in the Armies of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> to encounter with that horrid Monſter Death. But let us alſo wipe our Tears, and take good courage my beloved, for this ſame Lion of the Tribe of <hi>Juda</hi> hath order to fight with this dreadful Enemy, our victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and triumphing <hi>David,</hi> who hath torn in pieces the infernal Lion, bruiſed the antient Serpents Head, and <hi>ſpoiled Principalities and powers, triumphing of them in his Croſs,</hi> Col. 2.15. It is he that hath undertaken this glorious combat; It was for that purpoſe that he left for a while the Throne of God, the Father, and the company of his Holy Angels; 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 17. It was for that intent that he came into the Camp, and confuſion of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> contemning the ſhame and reproaches of his brethren. He hath not borrowed the weapons and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of the world, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. all that he hath taken from us, is our frail nature. But he, <hi>hath armed himſelf with
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:41646:15" rendition="simple:additions"/>righteouſneſs, as with a breaſt-plate, and hath put on the Helmet of ſalvation. He hath cloathed himſelf with ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance as with a garment, and hath covered himſelf with Jealouſie as with a cloak, he hath alone troden the Wine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs, and no body hath aſſiſted him;</hi> Iſa. 59. Iſa. 63. but his arme hath ſaved him, and his hand hath up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held him. As <hi>David</hi> cut off <hi>Goliahs</hi> Head with his own ſword, Jeſus Chriſt hath overcome Death by Death; like unto the powerful <hi>Sampſon,</hi> he hath deſtroyed all the Enemies of his Glory by his Death, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 17. He hath overcome in dying, him who had the Empire of Death, that is the Devil, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. and hath delivered them, <hi>who through fear of death, were all their life time ſubject to bondage,</hi> then was fulfilled this proof out of <hi>Hoſea. O death I will be thy plague, O grave I will be thy deſtruction,</hi> Hoſ. 13. and that of <hi>Iſaiah, He will ſwallow up death in victory, and the Lord God will wipe away tears from off all faces, and the rebuke of his people ſhall be taken away from off all the Earth.</hi> Iſai. 25. 1 Tim. 6. This bleſſed Prince, King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, who only hath immortality, and dwelleth in an inacceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble light, hath deſtroyed death, and brought to light life and immortality by the Gospel, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. <hi>O death where is thy victory, O grave where is thy ſting; The ſting of death is ſin, and the ſtrength of ſin is the Law, but bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed be God who hath given us the victory by our Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.</p>
            <p>This great God and Saviour hath perfectly redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us from Eternal death, as he himſelf doth teach us in the Goſpel of <hi>St. John,</hi> He that heareth my word and believeth on him that ſent me, hath everlaſting life, and ſhall not come into condemnation, but is paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed from death unto life, <hi>chap.</hi> 5.25. <hi>I am the living bread which came down from Heaven, if any man eat of this bread, he ſhall live for ever.</hi> Chap. 6.51. v. 40. <hi>Your fathers did eat Manna in the wilderneſs and are dead, This is the bread which cometh down from Heaven, that
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:41646:16" rendition="simple:additions"/>a man may eat thereof, and not dye,</hi> Chap. 8. <hi>Verily verily I ſay unto you, If any man keep my word, he ſhall never taſte of death. I am the reſurrection and the life, he that lives and believeth in me ſhall never dye, and he that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth in me, although he were dead, yet ſhall he live,</hi> Chap. 11. The wages of ſin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life by our Lord Jeſus Chriſt: Bleſſed and holy is he that hath part in the firſt reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, <hi>Revel.</hi> 20. the ſecond death ſhall never have any power upon him. In one word, the Gates of Hell, that is to ſay, Death, can do no prejudice to them that are built upon Jeſus Chriſt, the rock of Eternity. This merciful Saviour hath alſo delivered us from the ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al death, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. For we being dead in our treſpaſſes and ſins, he hath quickened us, and raiſed us up toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther unto newneſs of life, <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 2. He hath carried our ſins in his body upon the Croſs, that he dying unto ſin, we might live unto righteouſneſs. We are buried with him in his death by Baptiſme, that as Jeſus Chriſt is raiſed from the dead by the Glory of God the father, we alſo likewiſe ſhould walk in newneſs of life, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. <hi>Awake thou that ſleepeſt, and riſe from the dead, and Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt ſhall enlighten thee,</hi> Rom. 6. For by his death he hath not only reconciled us to God the Father, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 11. but he hath alſo procured unto us the Holy Spirit, that creates in us a new heart, and imprints the image of his Holineſs, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. He makes us become new creatures, and regenerates us by the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrptible ſeed. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. This is that which the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture names the firſt reſurrection, <hi>Revel.</hi> 20. <hi>St. Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> was raviſht in admiration at this great and wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful benefit, and therefore he acknowledgeth it. <hi>Bleſſed be the God, and Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, which according to his abundant mercy, hath begotten us again un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a lively hope, by the reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt from the dead,</hi> 1 Pet. 1. God diſcover'd to the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> a field cover'd with dry bones, and commanded him to
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:41646:16" rendition="simple:additions"/>prophecy upon thoſe bones, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 37. At the Prophets Command they began to draw near one another, then the Nerves began to appear, the Fleſh to grow, and to be covered with skin, but there was no life until God Commanded the Prophet to prophecy again, <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, Spirit come from the four winds, blow upon theſe dead bodies, and let them riſe from the dead.</hi> Then the Spirit entred into them, they began to revive, and they ſtood upon their Legs. This is the lively and true image of the firſt reſurrection; for the Spirit of God that blows whither it liſteth, doth regenerate us by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, <hi>John</hi> 3. and the new man is created in our hearts, by little and little as the Child grows in its Mothers Womb.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Joſhua</hi> brought the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> into the Land of Promiſe, he did not deſtroy all the Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 23. there remained ſome who became Scourges in their ſides, and Thorns in their Eyes. Thus our true and Spiritual <hi>Joſhua,</hi> who hath led us into the kingdom of his Grace, hath not altogether de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed all our evil affections; ſome yet remains that are like prickles in our ſides, and like ſwords that pierce through our ſouls; They do yet render our life bitter and unpleaſant, and therefore we often deſire death to come and put a period to this combat. Sin was in poſſeſſion of us, as a ſtrong man armed in an Houſe, but Jeſus Chriſt is entred into our Souls, and become the Maſter; He hath therefore bound and chain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſin, and hath nailed it to his Croſs: But this furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Beaſt, although it hath received a mortal wound, and is ready to give up the laſt gaſp, it ſtrugles and fumes within us, our bleſſed Saviour hath extinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Red Stream of his Blood, the infernal flames of all our curſed affections, but yet there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains in the aſhes ſome ſparkles of this deviliſh fire, that do cauſe in us ſome furious fits. This only mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful Redeemer of his infinite mercy, hath looſed us
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:41646:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>from the Devils Chains, but that we might have cauſe to be humbled, to deſire the increaſe of his Grace, and to long for the advent of his Glory, he leaves about us ſome of the troubleſome Fetters; by his Holy Spirit he files them off by degrees, but one day he will take them away from us. He doth now receive us as his beloved Children, into the Celeſtial Kingdom of his Grace, <hi>Joh.</hi> 11. nevertheleſs he ſuffers in us ſome ill-favoured reliques of ſin and corruption.</p>
            <p>At the voice of this Prince of Life, that reaches to the very bottom of our hearts, we are riſen from the ſepulchre of our Vices with our Grave-Cloaths about us, as <hi>Lazarus,</hi> when he came out of his Tomb; we are like the antient Slaves that were ſet at liberty, we bear upon our Forehead the viſible marks of our antient ſlavery, but one day our Lord Jeſus Chriſt ſhall cover theſe marks of infamy and diſgrace with an heavenly Diadem. If you deſire another image of our ſpiritual condition, fancy to your ſelves a dead man caſt into a foul Pit or Sink, unto whom life is reſtor'd in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; afterwards by degrees he is waſh'd and cleans'd of the filth that covers his body. We were not only dead of a Spiritual death, but we were alſo overwhelm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in an Abyſſe of corruption and filth. The Son of God hath pull'd us out of this Abyſſe, and hath alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy reſtored unto us life, but the dirt and putrefaction with which we were disfigured, he waſhes it away by the waters of his Grace, <hi>Za<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>.</hi> 13. <hi>For there is a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain opened for ſin in the Houſe of David,</hi> Iſai. 4. in the which God hath promiſed to waſh away all the filth of the Daughter of <hi>Sion,</hi> and all the bloud of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and as it happened to the cruel King <hi>Adonibezech,</hi> when the Tribe of <hi>Juda</hi> took him priſoner, he loſt the Thumbs of his Hands, and the great Toes of his Feet, but he did not ſuffer death until he was come to <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem;</hi> Thus our great God and Saviour, the Prince of the Tribe of <hi>Juda,</hi> hath cut off the ſtrength and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:41646:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>of the old man that did tyrannize in our ſouls, and hath deprived him of his venemous nails, with which he did wound our hearts; he hath alſo given him his mortal wound, but he ſuffers him to enjoy a languiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing life, and will not take away his laſt breath, until we bring him to the Gates of the heavenly <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to ſpeak more openly, ſin is yet in us, but he doth not Reign, for our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt hath broken its Scepter, and hath pull'd him from his Throne; and as he hath taken from it all Command in us, he conſtrains it to leave the poſſeſſion of our ſouls by degrees. As a ſtrong and mighty King, who having won the Battel, purſues and drives his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, until he hath totally expoſed him out of his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, ſo doth our Saviour deal with ſin.</p>
            <p>And as it happens with a Woman with Child in her old age, there is in her Body two contrary lives, that of the Mother, and that of the Child, the one decays and dies inſenſibly, the other, that is, the Childs life, grows and increaſeth by degrees: So it is in the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and regenerate Soul; There are two lives, that of Sin, that the Scripture names the Old man, and that of the New man, which is created according to God in Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, and true Holineſs; the one diminiſhes, and approacheth to its final end, but the other grows and gathers ſtrength until we arrive to the perfect ſtature of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the Spirit of God every day gets ground of our corruption and darkneſs. As it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens with the Rivers of freſh water, that encroach up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Earth, they undermine the neareſt Banks; or as the Sun when he riſeth upon our Horiſon, he drives before him all ſhadows, until the Air be perfectly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned, ſo it is with the Grace of God in our Souls.</p>

<pb n="29" facs="tcp:41646:18"/>to drop down into the Bladder, as into a Ciſtern, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to fail, <hi>Then ſhall the Body return to the Earth as it was, and the Spirit ſhall return unto God who gave it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To expreſs unto us this inevitable fate, <hi>Moſes</hi> reckons up all the antient Fathers, that have lived longeſt in the firſt world; he mentions ſome who lived 700, others 800, others 900 years, and ſome near a thouſand, <hi>Gen.</hi> 5. But when he hath well ſpoken of their deeds, and of the Children which they left in the world; he adds in the concluſion of all, And then ſuch an one died; So that our Creator doth execute upon all men, the Sentence once pronounced againſt <hi>Adam,</hi> the Father of all Mankind; <hi>Duſt thou art, and to duſt thou ſhalt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn,</hi> Gen. 3.</p>
            <p>By this means God declares his Juſtice and Truth, and accompliſheth what was ſignified by the antient Types, <hi>Levit.</hi> 14. For according to the Laws which God gave to <hi>Iſrael</hi> by <hi>Moſes,</hi> the houſe that was infected with the Leper, was to be demoliſhed and caſt into a noiſome place; There was a far more important reaſon for mans body to be deſtroy'd, and laid in the Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chre, becauſe he was created to be the Palace of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving God, the Dwelling of his Glory; But Sin that is a kind of infectious Leper, hath inſinuated it ſelf, and disfigured it; it hath entred the Skin, corrupted the Blood, diſordered the Spirits; it is crept into the Joynts and Marrow, and hath ſpeard its venom in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that there is none of our Members, but is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument of iniquity and unrighteouſneſs, Rom. 6.</p>
            <p>For the ſame reaſon, we cannot ſufficiently admire the difference that God had put between the Veſſel that were clean, and ſuch as were unclean; for he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, that the earthen Veſſel that was infected ſhould be broken to pieces, <hi>Levit.</hi> 11. but that ſuch as were of a more precious ſubſtance, ſhould be only waſht with water and purified with fire. <hi>Numb.</hi> 11. The Commands and Laws of the great God, are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:41646:19" rendition="simple:additions"/>Commentaries upon his actions; our Soul is like a Golden Veſſel, becauſe it is of a Spiritual and Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſubſtance; therefore God doth not altogether deſtroy it, although it be infected with ſin, but cauſeth it to be waſhed and cleanſed at the fountain of his infinite mercy; he purifies it with the blood of his Son, and cauſes it to paſs through the fire of his Holy Spirit; but for this miſerable Body, that is but an earthly Veſſel and Tabernacle, he doth break it to pieces, and reduce it to duſt and aſhes. It is my judgement, that death is an excellent means to demonſtrate the infinite power of our great God and Saviour; for the greater the diſeaſe is, the more admirable is the Cure; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt the finger of God, and his infinite power, is far more viſible in raiſing one man from the dead, than in preſerving many thouſands alive.</p>
            <p>As God is wont to draw light out of darkneſs, ſo he makes uſe of death to cauſe his infinite wiſdom to ſhine and appear to all his Creatures. Sin hath brought forth death, and death on the contrary, by a moſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate paricide, kills and deſtroys its Parent Sin, for it is Death that totally roots out of our Souls all corrupt affections.</p>
            <p>Moreover, God, who is the ſame yeſterday, to day, and for ever, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. will have all his Children paſs through the ſame path, to take poſſeſſion of his eternal Inheritance, and enter by the ſame Gate into his Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Palace; All the faithful of the Old Teſtament are gone already this way, <hi>through many tribulations,</hi> Acts 24. they are arrived to the kingdom of God, and through death they are come to the abode of life and immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. The Holy Scriptures that are inſpired of God tell us, That the <hi>Reubenites, and half of the Tribe of Manaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth,</hi> Numb. 32. Joſh. 1. left their dwellings which they had beyond <hi>Jordan,</hi> to go over and fight in the Army of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and that they did not offer to return, until God had given reſt to their brethren, and put them
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:41646:19" rendition="simple:additions"/>into a peaceable poſſeſſion of their inheritances; If I may make ſome ſtop, at ſuch an excellent Allegory, I may ſay that theſe paſſages repreſent unto us a lively image of the faithful that dye before the end of the world, for they leave their bodies, the abode and dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings of their ſouls, and they paſs through death, as through another <hi>Jordan</hi> into the Celeſtial <hi>Canaan,</hi> to encounter with God by their Prayers, in the ſociety of the firſt-born, whoſe names are regiſtred in Heaven, and they will not return to the bodies, that they have quitted, until the number of the Saints be compleat, until the building of the Church be finiſhed, and until our great <hi>Joſhua</hi> hath introduced us into his Eternal Reſt, and put us in poſſeſſion of the incorruptible in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance reſerved for us in Heaven; Then we ſhall not need to fight, but to enjoy peaceably the fruits of our victories, and to reſt for ever from all our labours. We ſhall have no cauſe to offer unto God Prayers and Supplications, but our buſineſs ſhall be to ſing unto him Praiſes and eternal Thankſgivings.</p>
            <p>The ſtrongeſt and the moſt conſiderable Reaſon in my judgement, of this our deſtiny is, That God hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtinated us to be comformable to the image of his Son, that he might be the firſt-born among many brethren; he will have us baptized with his Baptiſme, that we drink in his Cup, and that we enter into Bliſs by that ſame Gate, through which he hath already paſt through Shame and Diſgrace he is arrived to Glory, and through Death he is aſcended into life; he hath drunk of the bitter waters, before that he hath taſted of the Rivers of Celeſtial Joys, and he is gone down into the Grave be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he would mount up to the right hand of God.</p>
            <p>Although it is appointed unto all men once to dye, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. I dare maintain that death hath no cauſe to boaſt it ſelf, and that it cannot ſing Songs of Triumph with any Reaſon, becauſe that it looſeth the moſt glorious and happieſt victory; for we read in the Book of <hi>Eſther,</hi>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:41646:20" rendition="simple:additions"/>that King <hi>Ahaſuerus</hi> would not aboliſh nor recal the Proclamation that he had ſet forth againſt the Jews, but that he gave them full liberty to take up Arms to defend themſelves, to attack their Enemies, and to make them ſuffer all the evils that they intended againſt them: I find ſomething like unto this proceeding, for God would not call back the ſentence of Death that he had pronounced againſt Mankind, in the Garden of <hi>Eden;</hi> nevertheleſs he allows us, nay he commands his true <hi>Iſrael</hi> to take up Arms againſt Death, to conquer and trample it under feet.</p>
            <p>In the firſt place, Jeſus Chriſt who is our head, hath encountered with Death, and conquered it, he hath purſued it into its Trenches, and overcome it in its own Fortification; Death thought to have devoured him, but it hath been devoured it ſelf; as the Fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es are taken by the Hook that they think to ſwallow; and as the Bees do hurt thoſe whom they ſting, and doe greater harm to themſelves; for they cauſe but a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent pain in our body, and a heat that ſoon ceaſeth, but it cauſeth to it ſelf greater damage, for it breaks its ſting and looſeth thereby its life. Thus Death by fixing its ſting in the Humanity of Jeſus Chriſt, hath put him to a great deal of pain for a time, but it hath thereby loſt all ſtrength, vigor, and ſting, by this means.</p>
            <p>The men of <hi>Juda</hi> to ſatisfy the furious Philiſtins, delivered into their hands <hi>Sampſon,</hi> bound with Ropes, when they ſaw him, the Philiſtins gave ſeveral joyful ſhouts, but the Spirit of God came upon him in ſuch a manner, that he tore in pieces the two Ropes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he was bound, and overcame them by whom he was led away priſoner, and kill'd a thouſand of them. Thus the miſerable Jews for fear of the Romans, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd unto them our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, their Brother according to the fleſh, bound like a Malefactor: when Hell ſaw him nailed to the Croſs, and afterwards laid in a Grave, it did wonderfully rejoyce the Devil and
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:41646:20" rendition="simple:additions"/>his Angels began to ſing Songs of Triumph. But it was altogether unpoſſible, that the Prince of Life ſhould be detained in the Priſons of Death; he hath not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly broken out of the Grave by his infinite power, but he hath alſo trampled under feet all his moſt furious enemies, and overcame millions of infernal Fiends; and to declare how Life and Death were in his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, he hath Commanded Death, when he was, as it were a priſoner, ſhut up in its Dungeon. He hath broke open the Gates of this black priſon, and torn in pieces all its Fetters, for when he was yet in his Grave, he raiſed to life many that were dead, who were ſeen in the Holy City, and yet at preſent he holds in his hand the keys of Death, and of Hell: Therefore, as Children do rejoyce at their Fathers Victory, and as the Subjects are concerned at the proſperous pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings of their King, and as the Members are the better for the Glory and Honor of their Head; thus we may juſtly glory in the moſt notable Victories, and famous Triumphs of Jeſus Chriſt, who is our Father, King, and Head we may alſo juſtly glory, that we are Lords of Death, and that we have overcome it in the perſon of our Great God and Saviour; I ſay this after the Apoſtle <hi>St. Paul,</hi> That God hath quickened us to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and raiſed us together, and made us ſit toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Heavenly places with Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.</p>
            <p>Moreover, as our Saviour hath once overcome Death for us, he continues to overcome it in and by us; he doth not ſuffer us to encounter with our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies alone, nor doth he leave us in time of need; but as in a day of Battel, a wiſe and provident General hath an eye in every place, and encourages by his action and voice, his Soldiers whom he perceives at handy-blows with the Enemy, ſome he loads with praiſes, others with promiſes, by that means he encourageth ſuch as behave themſelves bravely; reſcues the weak and feeble, and to ſuch as are over-born, he furniſhes
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:41646:21" rendition="simple:additions"/>them with freſh Supplies; Thus deals with us our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt the great God of Hoſts, who ſits above in the Heavens in his triumphal Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ot, and beholds all our combats and encounters; when he perceives us too weak, that we might not be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by our moſt dreadful Enemies, he furniſheth us with his Holy Spirit, and his own Armor, as <hi>Jonathan</hi> did to <hi>David,</hi> when he deliver'd to him his Cloak, his Bow, his Belt and Sword; beſides this merciful Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our diſarms Death of its moſt hurtful weapons, and takes away all its Arrows and Darts.</p>
            <p>As the ſtrength and power of <hi>Sampſon</hi> did lodge in the hair of his Head, which the Philiſtines could never have imagined; ſo the ſtrength and power of Death conſiſts in ſuch things as the world do leaſt dream of. The moſt dreadful weapons with which it terrifies and beats us, are the Thunderbolts, and Curſes of the Law; and our ſins are as the poiſon in which it dips its Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows; or rather, our ſins are the fiery Dart with which it wounds and deſtroys us. Now Jeſus Chriſt hath <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed us from the Curſe of the Law, when he became a Curſe for us.</hi> Gal. 3. He hath carried our ſins in his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy upon the Croſs, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. And as the He-Goat Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>razel, he hath tranſported them away into an inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Deſart, <hi>Levit.</hi> 16. He hath removed them from the eyes of our God, as far as the <hi>Eaſt</hi> is from the <hi>Weſt.</hi> he hath caſt them into the bottom of the Ocean, and drown'd them in his Bloud, ſo that we now ſee ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled, what was foretold by the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> The iniquity of <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhall be ſought for, and there ſhall be none, and the ſins of <hi>Juda,</hi> and they ſhall not be found, <hi>chap.</hi> 50.</p>
            <p>Therefore being inveſted with the Grace of God, and armed with the Vertue of his Holy Spirit; Let us ſhew our courage and defie death; let us look it in the f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>e without fear, laugh at all its threats, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter with it without dread, for it is now but like
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:41646:21" rendition="simple:additions"/>a Soldier, who without his weapons carries himſelf proudly; It is like a Bee that buzzeth about without its ſting; It is like an old Lion that roars, but hath loſt all his Claws; It is like a Snake that would caſt its poyſon, but hath no venemous Teeth left, becauſe they have been all pull'd out by him who hath bruiſed the Serpents Head.</p>
            <p>If you conſider nothing but Deaths Exterior, its Face, and fearful appearance, its frightful Eyes, its mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger Body, its iron'd Hands; you cannot perceive any difference between the death of Gods Children, and that of the moſt wicked Varlets; but if you lift up the vizard and examine the Death of the one, and of the other, more exactly, you will meet with as much dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, as between Heaven and Earth, the Paradiſe of God and Hell, for as <hi>Moſes</hi>'s brazen Serpent, which he lift up in the Deſart, had the form and appearance of a burning Serpent, but nothing of the Priſon and Fire, thus the death of the faithful appears, as the death of other men, but hath not the deadly and pernicious conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, for it is not only a ſign and a teſtimony of Gods Grace and Favour but the beginning of our deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and the cure of all our Diſeaſes; As <hi>Moſes,</hi> when he had caſt wood into the waters of <hi>Marah,</hi> they had the ſame colour, but not the ſame bitterneſs and unplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant taſte: Thus the death of Gods deareſt Children hath the ſame tincture and appearance as before, but Chriſts Croſs hath taken away the danger, the trouble, and extracted out of it its unſufferable bitterneſs, and changed it into unſpeakable ſweetneſs. As <hi>Pharaoh</hi> was drowned, with all his Army, in the waters of the <hi>Red Sea;</hi> but the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> found a ſecure and a pleaſant paſſage into the promiſed Land; When they were arrived upon the other ſhoar of that dreadful Sea, they ſung unto God Songs of Triumph and Thankſgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving; Thus Death opens its Throat to devour the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates; It is an Abyſſe where they can find no bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:41646:22" rendition="simple:additions"/>but unto the Children of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it is a favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able paſſage into an eternal Bliſs; aſſoon as they are gone through, they are arrived to a place of Aſſurance, Joy, and Reſt, where God furniſheth them with Songs of Triumph and Thanſgiving to the Lamb, 1 <hi>Rev.</hi> 15.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Rod was turned into a Serpent, but <hi>Aaron</hi>'s being laid up in the Tabernacle, began to flouriſh and bear Almonds, <hi>Exod.</hi> 4. and 7. Thus while we are in the hands of the Law, Death is dreadful and terrible; but when we draw near to Chriſt the true Ark of the Covenant, it bloſſoms and brings Fruits forth of Joy and Eternal Comfort.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Balaam</hi> the Prophet was called to curſe the People of God, but he bleſſed it, contrary to the vain expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Balak,</hi> King of <hi>Moab.</hi> Thus Death hath been brought into the world by the Devil, to deſtroy, and utterly aboliſh the Holy Seed; but God by his infinite Goodneſs and Wiſdom, hath changed it into Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Bleſſing; Let us not therefore be any longer puzled to find out the meaning of <hi>Sampſons</hi> Riddle, <hi>Out of the eater came forth Meat, and out of the ſtrong came forth ſweetneſs,</hi> Judg. 14. For the Church of God unto whom Chriſt hath diſcover'd the moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Secrets of his Kingdom, teacheth us to ſeek the Hony, the ſweeteſt comforts, out of the Belly of this old Lion.</p>
            <p>It is not poſſible to Judge of Muſick by a Tone, or of an Oration by a Period, nor of a Comedy by a Scene. So we muſt not judge of a Battel by the firſt Aſſault, nor of a wreſtling by the firſt embraces and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of the wreſtlers, for ſome in the beginning of the Battel turn their backs, who nevertheleſs at the laſt, doe ſometimes win the day and the victory; and ſome in wreſtling are foiled at the beginning, who neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs at laſt ſupplant their Enemy, and caſt him upon the back; Therefore that we may better underſtand the great and notable advantages that we have over death,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:41646:22" rendition="simple:additions"/>we muſt examine it all along, until the end of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter; we muſt take notice of every Aſſault that we do give unto this unreconcileable Enemy.</p>
            <p>Aſſoon as the Taper of our Life, begins to burn, Satan, ſends forth his blaſts to extinguiſh it: Death labours to undermine 'this poor Dwelling, from the firſt moment that it was built, it beſieges it on all ſides; it makes its approaches, in time it ſaps the foundation, it batters us with ſeveral diſeaſes and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected accidents, every day it opens a breach, and pulls out of this building ſome ſtones: But if Death labours to demoliſh on her part, we on ours labour to repair; And as thoſe who built the Walls of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> held with one hand the Trowel, and with the other a Sword to ſight; ſo we defend our ſelves as well as we are able, againſt the aſſaults of Death; Therefore we do not only endeavour to preſerve this earthly Lodge that God hath Lett and Sett to us for a term, and to mend up the continual Dilapidations that happen in it; but at the very ſight of death, when it gives us the Aſſault, we do then alſo advance our Spiritual building, and labour to bring it to perfection, ſo that we may ſay as the Apoſtle <hi>St. Paul, If our outward man decays, the inward man is renewed day by day.</hi> 2 Cor. 4.</p>
            <p>To ſpeak true, Death meddles with nothing but with the exterior part of Man, for our principal Fort and chief Bulwark, doth neither fear to be undermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned nor ſapt, nor to be won by Aſſault, for it is rais'd above the Heavens, and built upon the Rock of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; it cannot be batter'd, for as the Thunderbolts, the ſtorms of Hail and ill weather cannot prejudice the Sunbeams, becauſe they are of a Spiritual nature, ſo all the Fury of the World, all the Powers of Hell, and the Rage of Death can never wrong the Soul, that is of a Spiritual and Immortal Nature. This Caſtle can never be famiſhed, for God furniſheth it with Manna from Heaven, and from the Rock upon which it is
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:41646:23" rendition="simple:additions"/>built, there runs a ſource of living waters, that riſeth to everlaſting life. In one word, as the Serpents do crawl only upon the Duſt, Death hath no power but upon the earthly part of Man; therefore our Lord Jeſus Chriſt adviſeth his Apoſtles, To not fear them that kill the Body, but cannot kill the Soul.</p>
            <p>At the very inſtant of our Souls ſeparation from the Body, Death ſee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s to have a great advantage upon us, but when I conſider all, I find that it hath no cauſe to glory, and that it is without reaſon that it chalenges the victory. When a valiant Captain marches out of a Town almoſt deſtroyed, to another more ſecure, and better fortified, with his weapons in his hand; we ſay that he hath quitted his ſtation, and not that he is over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come: Thus when this wretched Body decays, and that our Souls depart well armed with Faith and Hope, to lodge in a more ſecure place in the higheſt Heavens, no body can ſay, to ſpeak properly, that we have been overcome; And as it happens with ſuch as ſail on the wide Sea, when a violent ſtorm threatens them with Shipwrack they think themſelves very happy, if they can quit then Veſſel, leave it to the mercy of the Winds and Waves, and eſcape to Land with their Riches and Lives ſafe: Thus it is with us who ſail upon this tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſtuous Sea of the world; for when Death raiſeth its moſt cruel ſtorms; we think our ſelves happy if we can leave this miſcrable Body, which ſeems as a ſhip to our Souls, and if we can ſecure our Spiritual Life and our Heavenly Riches; Therefore we may juſtly ſay to the faithful Souls that are frighted when they ſee Death threatening to drown them in its depths, as <hi>St. Paul</hi> to his Ship-company, who did tremble for fear, at the ſight of a roaring and furious Sea; <hi>Take good courage my brethren, for I do aſſure you in the name of the living God, that your lives are ſecure, and that you ſhall looſe nothing but this Ship,</hi> Acts 27. We may yet furniſh them with ſtronger comforts, for theſe good Mariners loſt their
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:41646:23" rendition="simple:additions"/>Ship without any hopes of recovering it again; but we are aſſured that God will one day, gather up every piece of theſe broken Veſſels of our Bodies, and will joyn them together in a more perfect eſtate.</p>
            <p>Therefore Death doth not carry away our bodies by violence, but we leave them willingly, we do not ſtay for its ſummons, but we do prevent Death, and give it a Licence, when we have packt up our Bag and Baggage, we are ready to depart out of this wretched abode, where we endure all manner of calamities, for in this houſe defluxions do rain down, If Vapors do ariſe, the Pillars and Foundation does tremble, the Joynts do open, the Windows are darkened, and the burning Feavers, like violent fires, conſume it.</p>
            <p>I muſt not forget that the faithful do name their death, not only a removal of their Lodging, but a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval from a Tabernacle: this teacheth us that we muſt depart from hence with as much joy and readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as a Soldier doth out of his Tabernacle, at the end of a laborious and bloudy warfare; and with as much pleaſure as the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> did out of their Tents, under which they had remained in the Deſart, to enter into the ſweet and comfortable dwellings of the Land of <hi>Canaan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Not only this Body is like to an hired Houſe, or to a Tabernacle tranſported up and down, but it is by Sin, become to our Soul a woful priſon; Therefore Death may be compared to the Meſſengers ſent by King <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh,</hi> on purpoſe to take <hi>Joſeph</hi> out of his Dungeon, and bring him to his Palace; The Body that was crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to be a noble Pavillion of Joy and Honor, is become, to our Soul, a wretched and incommodious Priſon; Death is like to the Furnace of <hi>Babylon,</hi> that burned and conſumed the Bonds of the three Children, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out prejudicing their Perſons or Attire, <hi>Dan.</hi> 3. for it conſumes thoſe ſad Bonds that detain our Soul, en<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Therefore, whereas before we did look upon it with horror, as the very entrance of Hell; now we may behold it with Confidence and Joy, ſaying as <hi>Jacob</hi> did of <hi>Bethel, This is the Gate of Heaven.</hi>

            <p>Seeing therefore, that this is the nature and condition of Death, I find that Men do give it too much advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, for we ſhould not offer to ſay, that ſuch are dead whom God hath admitted into Eternal life; becauſe the qualification ſhould be derived from the chief and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt part; as it is in nature, there is no generation with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out corruption, and we commonly ſay, that it is a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration when the thing engendred is more excellent than the thing corrupted, as we ſay, that it is a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption when the thing corrupted excels the thing that is engendred; Therefore our change and removal out of this world, ſhould be rather ſtiled a Life than a Death; for if our Body Dies and Rots in the Earth, our Soul re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vives and mounts up to Heaven; and this mortal life that we leave in leaving the Earth, is nothing in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of that life that we ſhall enjoy with Chriſt and his Holy Angels: God is named the God of <hi>Abraham,</hi> of <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and of <hi>Jacoh. Now he is not the God of the Dead, but of the Living,</hi> Exod. 4. Matt. 22.</p>
            <pb n="41" facs="tcp:41646:24" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p>I may alſo, without any Figure, ſay, That Death in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the Body, is no real Death, but a kind of ſleep, as it is ſaid in the Prophet <hi>Daniel,</hi> Many do ſleep in the duſt of the Earth, <hi>chap.</hi> 12. and in <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> that the <hi>Juſt ſleep in their beds,:</hi> Therefore our Saviour ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Jairus</hi>'s Daughter, declared, <hi>The Child is not dead but ſleepeth,</hi> Mat. 9. and of <hi>Lazarus</hi> his friend, <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus our friend ſleepeth, but I go to awake him.</hi> Beloved, if thou art of the number of ſuch as Chriſt loveth, thy Death will be but a kind of ſleep, of a ſhort continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and a few days; The Lord will raiſe thee up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, <hi>For the hour cometh, and is already, That the Dead ſhall hear the voice of the Son of God, and they that ſhall hear ſhall revive,</hi> John 5. During this Life the aſſaults of Death are no better than light skirmiſhes, the moſt ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible and moſt dangerous blow that it ſtrikes in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, is when Death ſeparates the Soul from the Body; but the laſt and moſt ſignal encounter, which will put an end to all diſputes, will happen at the day of Judgement, Jeſus Chriſt will then appear from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in the company of all his immortal Angels and Saints, to encourage us to the encounter; He will come with a terrible voice of an Archangel, and the laſt Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet ſhall ſound, then Death will endeavor to keep us ſtill in its black priſon, and our Bones will be found without life or motion, but the Spirit of God ſhall breathe upon theſe dry Bones, and will cauſe them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive; As the Prophet <hi>Jonas</hi> was three days and three nights in the belly of the Whale, God Commanded the Fiſh to vomit him up again upon the ground. Thus, when we ſhall have made ſo long our abode in our Graves, as God hath appointed in his wiſdom, Death ſhall be conſtrained to reſtore all that it hath ſwallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and as <hi>Daniel</hi> came out of the Lions Den by break of day, theſe ſavage Beaſts having done him no harm; Thus, at the break of the laſt day, at the Riſing of the Sun of Righteouſneſs, we ſhall all go out of Deaths
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:41646:25"/>deep Den; and as if God had ſent his Angel on purpoſe to ſhut the mouth of this old Lion, we ſhall then find that he ſhall have done us no harm; inſtead of devouring of us, he will prove a faithful keeper of our bones; therefore the faithful may ſpeak unto Death in the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of the Prophet <hi>Micah, Rejoyce not againſt me O mine Enemy, when I ſhall fall I ſhall riſe, when I ſit in darkneſs the Lord ſhall be a light unto me.</hi> Mic. 7.8. As <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaid to <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> we will go into the Wilderneſs to ſacrifice unto God, we will go out of thine <hi>Egypt</hi> with our young, and with our old, with our Sons and with our Daughters, with our Flocks, and with our Heards, there ſhall not an Hoof be left behind. <hi>Exod.</hi> 10. Thus we, in an Holy Confidence, may talk with Death, maugre thy Rage and Fury, we will go up to Heaven to ſacrifice unto our God immortal praiſes, we ſhall get out of thy ſlavery; We, our Wives, our Children, our Brothers and Siſters, our Parents and Friends; all the People of God whom thou doſt at preſent keep in a cloſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint; notwithſtanding the infernal attempts of thine inhumane power, there ſhall not remain ſo much as an handful, no not ſo much as the leaſt grain of our Aſhes behind us. When the Son of God ſhall appear in his Glory from Heaven, he ſhall conſume all Death's Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phies and Monuments, with irreſiſtable Flames, ſo that it ſhall happen to this imperious Enemy of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, as it happened to the Kings of the Amorites mentioned in the Iſraelitiſh Hiſtory, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 10. for as <hi>Joſhua</hi> ſuffered them to live until he was returned from his victory, and then, when he had perfectly overcome all his Enemies, he Commanded them to be brought forth, and gave order to his Captains to tread upon their necks, and then with his own ſword he diſpatcht them, caſt them into a Cave, and cauſed great ſtones to be rowled at the entrance of it: Thus ſhall our true and Celeſtial <hi>Joſhua</hi> deal with Death, he ſuffers it to reign while he is gone to purſue his Enemies; for the
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:41646:25" rendition="simple:additions"/>laſt Enemy that ſhall be deſtroyed by him is Death; when he ſhall have perfectly ſubdued all other Enemies, he will then conclude all his victories with a glorious end, and accompliſh the Churches Triumph, by cauſing us to trample upon Death; that ſhall be caſt into the bottomleſs pit, whereof the entrance ſhall be ſhut up for ever, <hi>Rev.</hi> 10. then ſhall be accompliſht this glorious Propheſie, <hi>Death is ſwallowed up in victory,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. for the Spirit of God aſſures us in expreſs words, <hi>That Death ſhall be no more.</hi> By what we have ſaid, it may eaſily appear what is become of the Rope thrice twiſted by the Devil, with an intent to ſtrangle therewith all Mankind; for the Son of God hath cut in pieces the firſt of theſe unhappy ties, by his Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty power, by the Spirit of Sanctification he looſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens the ſecond by degrees, and by the laſt he draws us to himſelf, and then he burns and conſumes it altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; therefore we have no reaſon to fear an Eternal Death, nor to tremble when Hell opens wide its mouth: If we reſiſt the Devil he flies away from us, <hi>Jam.</hi> 4. at laſt we ſhall trample him under our feet, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16. It is true, that the ſad and doleful effects of the Spiritual death, do commonly draw out of us many a ſad Groan and Tear, whilſt our Soul remains in this ſinful Fleſh, we are already got out of the Tombs of Corruption and Sin, but yet bear about us, as it were, our Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-ſheet, and ſome odd Reliques of our natural Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. But we have this conſideration to comfort our droop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſpirits, That Chriſt will ſhortly give the ſame or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der from Heaven for us, as he did for <hi>Lazarus, Looſe him and let him go,</hi> Joh. 11. So that inſtead of the corruption of our Nature, that is ſo incommodious to us, he will inveſt us in Eſtate of Glory, Incorruption. Immortality, and perfect Happineſs; for the Corporal Death, we may juſtly ſay, That our Lord and Saviour hath freed us from all the fears that it might beget in us, ſo that it is my judgement, that we may not only
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:41646:26"/>affirm, that we have not the leaſt apprehenſion of it, but expect it with aſſurance, for if we be truly of the number of the faithful, and Gods adopted Sons, we hope, deſire, and haſten Deaths arrival by our moſt carn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, and moſt paſſionate wiſhes.</p>
            <p>What I have already declared in this Chapter, might ſatisfy any Chriſtian Soul, and furniſh it with ſufficient conſiderations to ſtrengthen it againſt all apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Death; But as one that is wont to buy Stuffs in a Shop, when he cheapens ſuch as are ſlight, and of a ſmall value, he caſts his eye only upon a piece or a pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern, and by that judges of the reſt; but when he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to purchaſe a rich Tapeſtry of great value, he deſires to viſit and conſider every part, one after an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, and make an eſtimation of the value and beauty of every corner; So I judge, that the Wiſe and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Reader will deſire now, that I have diſcover'd to him in groſs, the Body of <hi>Conſolations againſt the fears of Death,</hi> that I ſhould in the next place un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold theſe hidden Excellencies, produce every part of them by degrees to his contemplation, and with my Pen, make him take notice of all the Rarities.</p>

               </p>
            </argument>
            <p>AS a wiſe and diſcreet Phyſitian uſually examines with care, the cauſes of the Diſeaſe before he preſcribes a Remedy; and as an experienced Chirurgion ſearcheth the wound before he claps the Plaiſter to it; Thus I judge it neceſſary to ſeek with diligence from whence the fears of death proceed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we ſhall appoint the Remedies to the faithful Souls; for when we ſhall have perfectly underſtood the nature
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:41646:26" rendition="simple:additions"/>of the Diſeaſe and its principal Cauſes; we ſhall with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out difficulty be better able to aſſign a convenient Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy; when we ſhall have ſearcht the wound, and waſht it clean, we will, with Gods aſſiſtance, pour in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it the true Balm of <hi>Gilead.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, we have juſt reaſon to accuſe our ſelves of too much unmindfulneſs of Death; we don't meditate, ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten as we ſhould, upon the miſery and frailty of our poor and deſpicable nature; we acknowledge it, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs with our tongues, that our life is but a breath in our Noſtrils, a vapor that ſoon diſappears, a ſhadow that quickly vaniſhes away; but in the mean time we flatter our ſelves in our hearts, with more pleaſant thoughts and deſire, as <hi>Herod,</hi> that Men ſhould look upon us as ſo many little Gods, <hi>Acts</hi> 12. We ſuffer our ſelves to be deceived by the flattering inſinuations of our corrupted Fleſh, and by the artificious ſuggeſtions of the old Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, that whiſpers to us as to our firſt Parents, <hi>You ſhall not dye,</hi> Gen. 3.</p>
            <p n="2">2. We commonly affirm, that Death is inexorable without Ears; nevertheleſs we live as if we had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded an agreement with Death, and had ſecret intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence with the Grave, <hi>Iſ.</hi> 22. Death approaches with Feet of Wooll, without noiſe, we imagine therefore that it will never come near us, as that wicked ſervant of the Goſpel, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. that gathered from his Maſters delays of coming, that he would not come at all. We hate and abominate the ſight of all thoſe things that repreſent to us any appearance of Death, or that calls into our minds its remembrance, if at any time its Image comes in our way, we turn from it our Eyes, and baniſh out of our fancy, all imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of it, as of a moſt odious and deceitful illuſion. Death ſeizeth upon us before we have well thought whither we be mortal or no; Therefore we are ſooner ſurprized and aſtoniſhed at its approaches, and we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come like the fooliſh Iſraelites, that trembled and fled
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:41646:27" rendition="simple:additions"/>before <hi>Goliah,</hi> becauſe they were not accuſtomed to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold him.</p>
            <p n="3">3. We have too great confidence, and depend too much upon ſecond Cauſes; we look upon Death as a thing that happens by chance, or as an evil that may be prevented, or at leaſt put away from us for a time; whereas we ſhould be fully perſwaded, that God hath determined and appointed, not only Death it ſelf, but alſo all the cauſes and means by which it commonly happens; Therefore we are often fill'd with diſpleaſure, and reduced to murmure and repine againſt God; we grin, and bite the ſtone, inſtead of adoring, in all humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, that wiſe Hand that caſts it: In a word, when ever Death comes to us, we are ready to ſay to it, as the Devils to our Saviour, <hi>Wherefore art thou come to tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment us before the time,</hi> Matth. 3.</p>
            <p n="4">4. We are too much wedded to theſe earthly vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, we are inſeparable from the World, we would willingly make here our abode for ever, and cannot abide to hear, that Death will remove us; Our unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful affections have no bounds, and we often ſpend our ſelves in the purſuance of the miſerable advantages of the Earth. When we come almoſt to the end of our life, and of our mortal journey, it is then, that many of us are moſt earneſt to make a large proviſion of World<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Vanities; we build ſtately dwellings, and ſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Palaces at that very moment, when we ſhould think of nothing but of building our Tomb, and preparing our Winding-ſheet. We have ſo violent a paſſion for all the advantages of this life, that to ſeparate us from them, it is to pluck out our Hearts, and tear our tendereſt Bowels. When Death comes to our Bedſide, and offers to pull us out, we are ready to ſay as the Sluggard in the <hi>Proverbs, A little ſleep, a little ſlumber, a little folding of the hands,</hi> Prov. 6. When our Divine Bridegroom knocks at our Gates, we are ſcarce willing to abandon our Delights, as the Spouſe
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:41646:27" rendition="simple:additions"/>in the <hi>Canticles;</hi> what ſaith the Worldling, Muſt I leave my ſumptuous Palaces, my pleaſant Dwellings, and my delightful Gardens? Muſt I relinquiſh all this rich Tapeſtry, theſe precious Moveables, and all theſe rare and exquiſite Ornaments that enrich my Parlors, Chambers, and Cloſets? Muſt this unmerciful Death di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt me ſo ſoon of all my Offices and Dignities, and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der me from a full and peaceable enjoyment of all theſe Riches and Treaſures? Muſt it raviſh from me, in an inſtant, all my Delights and ſatisfactions? Is there no remedy, but muſt I be pluckt from the embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of my beloved Wife, from the ſight of my dear Children, and from the ſweet company of all my friends? Muſt I receive no more the ſervices of my Domeſticks? When we are in this miſerable diſpoſition, it is no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der if death is terrible to us, and if it cauſeth us to reſent the ſharpneſs of its ſting, for as <hi>Abſalom</hi> when he was hanging by the hair of his Head, in a Tree of the Forreſt, <hi>Joab</hi> took three Darts and ſtruck him through the Heart; thus when our affections are too much wedded and entangled with the World and its vanities, and fill'd with the expectation of earthly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentments; it is then that they are miſerably expoſed to all the Darts and violent attempts of Death.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Another principal cauſe of the fear of Death, is our ill Life; We give our ſelves over to the vices, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baucheries, and licenciouſneſs of this unhappy Age, we ſuffer our ſelves to be corrupted by ill company, and carried away with the Torrent of vicious Cuſtoms. It is therefore no wonder if death fills our Souls with apprehenſions, for it comes to us armed with our ſins, and is preceded by the remorſe of Conſcience, and hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of our Crimes; How came it to paſs, that ſuch a terrible aſtoniſhment fell upon King <hi>Belſhazzar,</hi> when he ſaw the fingers of an hand writing upon the Wall of his Palace, the Sentence of his doom, <hi>Dan.</hi> 5. It was becauſe he did profane the Holy Veſſels of God's
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:41646:28" rendition="simple:additions"/>Houſe; and becauſe he did riot in the company of laſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious Women. Wherefore did <hi>Felix</hi> tremble, when he heard <hi>St. Paul</hi> diſcourſe of <hi>Juſtice, Temperance, and of Judgement to come,</hi> Acts 24. It was becauſe he was a wicked Varlet, given over to all manner of filthy and unjuſt living. Thus, becauſe we profane the Members of our Body, that are as the Veſſels of Gods Sanctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and Houſe, and becauſe our life is vicious and diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly, we can't abide to hear death mention'd, and when it comes to us, we are ready to ſpeak to it in <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lix</hi>'s language to <hi>St. Paul, Depart for this time.</hi> So that the love of Sin, and the fear of Death, are as two Siſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers that hold one another by the hands; or rather, they are as Twins that are born and dye together. As the Prophet <hi>Amos</hi> ſaid to the Iſraelites, <hi>Ye put for away the evil day, and cauſe the ſeat of violence to come near;</hi> Amos, 6. So may we ſay to the Men of this age; Ye put far from you the day of Death, as much as you are able, and draw near to all manner of Impurity, Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs, Ambition, Pride, Vanity, Uſury, Rapine, Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, Envy, Malice, and ſuch like Soul-plagues. You don't only draw near to theſe abominable Vices, but you do alſo worſe, to lodge them in your Bowels, and to plant them in your Hearts; Certainly we may very well apply to all vicious perſons, what the Prophet <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remy</hi> tells of <hi>Jeruſalem; Her filthineſs is in her skirts, ſhe remembreth not her laſt end,</hi> Lam. 1.</p>
            <p n="6">6. I have taken notice of another imperfection in us; we miſtruſt the Providence of God, and know not how to repoſe our ſelves upon his Fatherly Care; we have a too worthy eſteem of our ſelves, and of our own ſufficiency; We can't reſolve to dye, becauſe we fancy our ſelves very uſeful in the world, and that our Death would bring a conſiderable loſs to the Church of God to the State, or to our Family.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Becauſe the Soul and Body are linkt together in a very ſtrict union; we can't imagine how they can
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:41646:28" rendition="simple:additions"/>be ſeparated without great and unſpeakable pangs; our infidelity is ſo great, that we can't reſt ſatisfied up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the promiſe of God, who engages to ſuccor us in our diſtreſs, and to deliver us from all our troubles, <hi>Iſ.</hi> 50. It is true, <hi>Jacob's</hi> Ladder that reaches from the Earth to Heaven, doth fill us with admiration; but it ſeems, moſt difficult and uneaſy to aſcend. Paradice is Rich, Glorious, and Delightful to the uttermoſt; but its Gate is ſtrait, and choakt up with Thorns and Bry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.</p>
            <p n="8">8, I judge that one of the chief cauſes of the fear of death, is, becauſe we look upon God as a moſt ſevere and mercileſs Judge inflamed with anger and fury a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us, and armed with vengeance. Whereas we ſhould conſider and acknowledge him to be a merciful Father, full of compaſſion and kindneſs for Mankind. Every Slave trembles at the ſight of his Lord, and there is no Malefactor but is afraid, when he appears before his Judge, to be put to the queſtion; and can I who am all ſpotted with ſin, and black with my horrid crimes: can I appear before that Glorious Throne, that cauſes the Seraphims to cover their Faces with their Wings, <hi>Iſ.</hi> 6. How can I that am but ſtubble ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in the preſence of the God of vengeance, <hi>who is a conſuming fire,</hi> Heb. 10.</p>
            <p n="9">9. There is another viſible fault in us we don't im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace with a true and lively Faith, the Death and Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of our Lord and Saviour; we all ſpeak of Jeſus Chriſt crucified, but we don't know the Divine Vertue of his Crucifixion, nor feel its Efficacy; we don't con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider that his death hath torn in pieces the partition that did ſhut us out of the Heavenly Sanctuary, and that his blood doth trace us a way to Paradiſe, and procure an entrance into that place of Eternal Bliſs.</p>
            <p n="10">10. We don't repreſent to our ſelves as we ought, to remove from our fancy the horror of the Sepulchre, how our Lord and Saviour hath bin laid himſelf in the
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:41646:29" rendition="simple:additions"/>Grave, and perfum'd it with his Holy and Divine ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings. We don't imprint into our imagination, that it is juſt and reaſonable that we ſhould be conformable to Chriſt in his abaſement, if we will have any ſhare with him in his Glory and exaltation.</p>
            <p n="11">11. Beſides, that which nouriſheth in our Souls the fears of Death is this, we look upon it as if it were in its full ſtrength and vigor; whereas we ſhould remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that Jeſus Chriſt hath overcome and diſarm'd Death by his powerful Reſurrection, and that for our parts we need but follow the footſteps of his Glorious victories, and faſten that furious Beaſt to his Triumphant Chariot.</p>
            <p n="12">12. We don't conſider as we ſhould, with a ſerious and religious application of the mind; How our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour Chriſt is not only riſen from the Sepulchre, victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious of death, but that he is alſo aſcended up into the higheſt Heavens, as our fore-runner, to prepare a place for us, and that by departing out of our miſerable bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, we follow the footſteps of our ever Bleſſed Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, to reap with him the fruits of his moſt Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Victories.</p>
            <p n="13">13. We ſtoop too much to conſider our frail, corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible, and mortal Nature, and we ſeldom enter into this moſt uſeful Meditation; That by the Holy Ghoſt we are nearly and unſeparably united with Jeſus Chriſt the Prince of Life, and the Source of Light; and that we have already in us the Seeds of Bleſſedneſs, of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and Immortality.</p>
            <p n="14">14. As the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> did murmure againſt <hi>Moſes</hi> in the Deſart, and did wiſh to be again in <hi>Egypt.</hi> This did proceed from a forgetfulneſs of their bitter ſlavery, under which they had groan'd, and of their painful labouring amongſt the Bricks, and the heat of the Furnaces, and from their mindfulneſs of the pleaſures alone, which they had loſt; They dream't of nothing, but of the plenty of Bread and Fleſh, of
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:41646:29" rendition="simple:additions"/>the Cucumbers, Onions, and of the Meats, with which they had ſo often fill'd their bellies; Thus we do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine at death, becauſe we don't dream of the evils from which it delivers us, but think only upon the vain pleaſures and ſeeming advantages, of which it robs us.</p>
            <p n="15">15. We imagine that Death deſtroys and reduces us to nothing. And we don't conſider, that it never med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles with the principal part of our being, but only pulls off from us Sin, and breaks the reſt of the Chains of our Spiritual Bondage; ſo that Death is rather the Death of Sin, than of the faithful.</p>
            <p n="16">16. Here is another great fault in us, We don't lift up our minds to conſider the Glory prepared for us at the Egreſs of our Souls, out of our mortal Bodies: How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we may demean our ſelves, and what ever we may ſay, we don't firmly, without doubting, believe the Felicities which God promiſeth to us in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of his Face. Sometimes we may think up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the joys of Paradiſe, but it is a thought that doth paſs through our Souls with too much ſpeed, and don't take any root, ſo that there be many, if they were not aſhamed, would be ready to ſpeak in that Emperor <hi>Adrian</hi>'s Language, <hi>My little Soul, my deareſt darling, O Gueſt and Companion of my Body, whither art thou now going?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="17">17. To theſe former cauſes of the fears of Death in us we may add another; That we caſt too much, and ſuffer our eyes to dwell upon the rottenneſs and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption that threatens our Body; whereas we ſhould carry our eye-ſight to behold its Glorious Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that ſhall ſoon follow. Pleaſant Abode, and delightful Companion of my Soul, muſt Death, this cruel Death, ſeparate it from thee with ſo much vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence? Muſt thou part with thy dear and ſweet compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny? Muſt my Soul leave thee upon ſuch grievous and lamentable terms? That of ſo many Honors which have
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:41646:30" rendition="simple:additions"/>been heapt upon thee, thou ſhalt not carry ſo much as their ſhadow to the Grave? That of ſo many rich Moveables and Treaſures, thou ſhalt bear away no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a Winding-ſheet, a few Boards, or at the moſt, ſome pounds of Lead? When thou haſt lived in ſo much ſplendor and magnificence, muſt thy cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing be at laſt the Worms? When thou haſt walkt ſo proudly in Palaces, Gilded with Gold, and perfum'd, muſt at laſt thy confinement be in a ſtinking and loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Sepulchre?

            <argument>
               <p>
                  <hi>The firſt Remedy againſt the fears of Death, is to Meditate often upon it.</hi>
               </p>
            </argument>
            <p>WE become acquainted with the moſt dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful things by cuſtome and converſation, freſh Soldiers do commonly quiver and ſhake at the ſight of an Enemy; they tremble at the Volleys of Shot, and, half dead, fall to the ground at the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid noiſe of the great Ordnance; but when their cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage hath been hardened by a long exerciſe, they can
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:41646:30" rendition="simple:additions"/>then, without fear, ſeek the Enemy in his greateſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, and can go as merrily to the Combat as to a Feaſt, or to a Triumph; The ſhowers of ſmall ſhot, the Lightning and Thunder of the Canon, can't make them ſo much as to ſhut their eyes, or ſtoop their heads; They do then laugh at their former apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; Thus the firſt conceits of Death do commonly terrify us, but when we ſeriouſly meditate upon it, and look it in the face, we ſhall not only contemn it, but we ſhall alſo ſeek it boldly in its retreats, and with an aſſured and undaunted countenance, we ſhall behold Death let fly all its Arrows and Launces, all its Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbolts, without the leaſt apprehenſion; As it is with them who are not wont to ſee Savage Beaſts, they dare not draw near to them, and can ſcarce look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them without fear; but ſuch as are familiarly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with them, can touch them without ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion, and freely play with them. Thus it is with thoſe who have never had the confidence to look Death in the face, they tremble and are fill'd with aſtoniſhment, aſſoon as they ſee its approaches, but thoſe who do often behold Death, are familiarly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with it, and therefore they can with confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence thruſt their Fiſts into its jaws. <hi>Moſes</hi> fled away from his Rod, when it was firſt turned into a Serpent; but when he began to take it into his hands, and ſaw that it return'd to its former ſhape and being, he was far from running from it, or entertaining the leaſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of it; but rather he made a very happy uſe of it, and by Gods Command he wrought many great miracles. Thus it is with Death, it frights us at firſt, but if we can but take hold of it with the hands of a true and lively faith, it will be ſo far from ſcaring or frighting of us, that it will diſcover to us a world of delightful Wonders.</p>
            <pb n="54" facs="tcp:41646:31" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p>Death therefore is ſo far from terrifying ſuch as are accuſtomed with it, that it fils them full of comfort and joy; as a Child that looks upon his Father, who hath a Vizard on his face, is frighted, and begins to cry, but if he hath but the confidence to pull off the Vizard, and take but notice of the loving ſmiles of his Parent, hid under that horrid deformity, he will not only ceaſe from weeping, and ſettle his mind, but he will alſo leap for joy, and embrace him. Thus if we look upon Death with a timerous countenance, and behold its hideous appearance, we ſhall be ſtruck with a ſudden horror, but if we can with any aſſurance lift up its ugly Vizard, we ſhall ſoon diſcover our heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Father, and with tears of Joy we ſhall run to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace him: as the Apoſtles when they eſpied our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our in the night walking upon the Waves of the Sea, cried out in a fright, thinking that it had been a Spirit; but when he drew near to them, and heard his voice, they perceiv'd him to be their Saviour, when therefore they took him into their Ship, the ſtorm ceas'd imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately; Thus if we look upon Death at a diſtance, the blindneſs and ignorance with which we are poſſeſs'd, will repreſent to us a frightful Spirit, but if we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine and behold it nearer by the help of the Gospel Light, we ſhall find it to be our Salvation, and the accompliſhing of our Redemption. All our fears will then be calm'd, and our Souls will return to their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer repoſe: In a word, as he that runs from his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, increaſes his courage, and renders him more earn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and reſolved to purſue him; Thus when Death ſees us tremble and decline its approaches, it becomes more proud and imperious over us. We muſt therefore think betimes of Death, repreſent it to our ſelves continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and enter into an acquaintance with it; it was ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Job's</hi> practice, for he <hi>cried unto the Pit, thou art my Father, and to the Corruption and the Worms, you are my Mother, and my Siſters,</hi> Job 16. And imagine that this was
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:41646:31" rendition="simple:additions"/>the chief reaſon of <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Macedon</hi>'s commanding a Page every morning to rouſe him up out of his ſleep, with <hi>O King, remember that thou art a mortal man.</hi> For by this often repeated Leſſon, he labour'd to humble his lofty mind, and teach his frail nature not to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry too much in the ſplendor of his Crown and Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, nor to abuſe the power committed to his Truſt. By this means alſo he became acquainted with Death, that it might not ſeem ſtrange when it ſhould come in earneſt to ſnatch him away. This was alſo the deſigne of that Emperor <hi>Meruaan,</hi> or <hi>Meruanes,</hi> who cauſed this Motto to be Engraven upon his Seal, <hi>Remember that thou muſt dye.</hi> Theſe words did call to his mind that which his Courtiers did not dare to mention to him. So that this great Prince never confirm'd with his Seal, the death of any man; but at the ſame time he did repreſent to himſelf, that his own death was not to be avoided; for the ſame reaſon, the Noblemen of <hi>China</hi> are wont to have their Coffins ready made betimes in their Chambers, that at every moment they might look Death in the face; for the ſame cauſe the Aegyptians in their moſt ſumptuous Feaſts, did com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly place a dead mans Scull in an eminent corner of the room; by this ſpectacle they intended not only to oblige the Gueſts to a moderation of their Joys, and to a curbing in of their unruly Luſts, but alſo to bring them acquainted with, and to accuſtome them to behold it amongſt all their Delights. They trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Death, as if their deſigne had been to invite it to their moſt delicious Feaſts, that they might rejoyce to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with it, <hi>Iohn.</hi> 19. I conceive that the Jews for the ſame cauſe did build their Sepulchres in their Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens of Pleaſure, that they alſo might have the image of death continually before them; and that in the midſt of all their divertiſements, it might be their moſt pleaſant and ordinary entertainment. For us Chriſtians, to oblige us to think upon Death, there is
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:41646:32" rendition="simple:additions"/>no need that a Page ſhould remember us every day that we are Mortal, nor that the Motto of a Ring ſhould call to our minds, that we muſt dye; there is no need of a Coffin to be plac'd in our Chambers: in ſuch things there is many times more Oſtentation than Piety; nor is it needful that a dead mans Skull be put before our Eyes, or that a Sepulchre be built or hewen in our Gardens, and places of Recreation and Delight; for as <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, underſtood that he was a Mortal Man, by the Bloud that ran out of his Wounds; Thus the Diſeaſes unto which we are ſubject, and the daily infirmities that we feel, do ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently inſtruct, and aſſure us, that we are Mortals; And as a famous Philoſopher when he receiv'd the unhappy news of his only Son's untimely death, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd the Meſſenger with a ſetled countenance; <hi>I knew, ſaid he, that I had begot him a Mortal man,</hi> Xenoph. Thus will the faithful ſay, without change of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance or appearance of fear, when his death is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd to him; I knew that my Mother had conceiv'd me a Mortal Man; I knew very well that Death is the Tribute that we muſt all pay to Nature, and that upon this condition, I am enter'd into the world.</p>
            <p>If we will make uſe of any exterior help, to imprint this Leſſon into our Fancy, we muſt practice with care the advice of the wiſe man, It is better to go to the houſe of Mourning, than to that of Feaſting, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 7. for that is the end of all Men, and the living will lay it to his heart; never look upon a diſeaſed Body ſtretch'd upon a Bed, nor upon a dead Corps in a Cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin; but remember that this is an univerſal Law, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which all Mankind muſt pay obedience; and that it is the broad Road of all the Earth, and that there thou mayeſt behold the lively image of thy future Eſtate. I conceive that this may be a good expedient and very ſucceſsful to entertain in our minds the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual thoughts of Death, to make our laſt Will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:41646:32" rendition="simple:additions"/>and frequently to peruſe it; for as it happens when we meditate upon a farewel, that we are to take of our friends, we feel in our ſouls the ſame affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and motions, as are in us at the moment of our ſeparation. Thus, will it be with us when we ſeriouſly meditate upon the laſt farewel, that we are to bid to the World. Death appears to us upon our Lips, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we fancy our ſelves at that inſtant, already in the ſweet embraces of our Divine Jeſus, our Glorious Redeemer.</p>
            <p>Beſides thoſe things that are unuſual and extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, I find nothing in, nor out of us, nothing that we feel, taſte or reliſh, in ſhort, nothing that paſſeth either in our, private or publick converſation, but is able to renew in our minds the ſerious conſideration of Death. The Fleſh that thou doſt eat, the Wooll that cloaths thy nakedneſs, the Silk that adorns thy Body; in general, all thy Garments and Ornaments are but the ſparkles of the Dead Creatures; the ſight there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of all theſe things, muſt call to thy remembrance thy frail and mortal Eſtate, and cauſe thee to meditate upon the Preachers ſaying. <hi>The ſame accident that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens to the Beaſt, the ſame happens to Mankind, as is the death of the one, ſo is the death of the other.</hi> They have all the ſame Breath, and Man hath no advantage above a Beaſt, for all is vanity, all goes to the ſame place, all proceeds from the Duſt, and ſhall return to the Duſt again.</p>
            <p>Never pull off thy Cloaths, but remember that thou muſt ſhortly quit this miſerable Body, and lay it down in the Grave: When thou art entring into thy Bed, think upon thy Sepulchre, where thou muſt one day be ſtretch'd; If thou doſt awake in the night, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that Death will ſhortly come, and put out the Taper of thy Life; let thy Sleep be an image of thy Death, and let it call to thy mind, how thou muſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a few days, ſleep in a bed of Duſt, when thou awakeſt,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:41646:33" rendition="simple:additions"/>think upon the delightful ſound of the Arch-Angel's Trumpet, that ſhall rowſe thee out of Deaths long ſleep: ſay within thy ſelf when thou ariſeſt, It may be that I ſhall never riſe again till the Son of God ſhall come from Heaven, to lift me up out of the Grave with his Almighty hand; when we caſt our Eyes upon the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Sun, Let us ſay within our ſelves, it may be I ſhall never behold any other Sun riſe again, but the Son of Righteouſneſs, that carries healing under his wings; Conſider when thou doſt put on thy Garments, that the time is coming, when thou muſt be cloathed with a more Magnificent and Glorious Robe, a Robe of Light and Immortality; when thou doſt ſit down to eat, think upon the hour that is drawing near, in which death will feed upon thy Carkaſs; imagine that it may be, that this is the laſt time that thou ſhall ſit at the Table, that next thou mayſt ſit with <hi>Abraham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> with all the bleſſed Martyrs, who have waſh'd and whiten'd their Robes in the Blood of the Lamb, and that it may be, that thou ſhalt never taſte any more but of the food of Angels, and of the fruit of the Tree of Life, and that thou ſhalt never drink but of the new Wine in the Kingdom of Heaven, and of the Rivers of Eternal pleaſures, that run from the Throne of God.</p>
            <p>Every time that thou goeſt out of thy dwelling, or changeſt thy abode, fancy to thy ſelf that in a ſhort time thou muſt depart out of this Mortal Tabernacle. Art thou alone, and ſeparated from humane Society? remember that within a few days, Death will ſeparate and divide thee; art thou going to any meeting, or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring into any company, or marching to the Holy Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies; diſcourſe with thy ſelf in this manner, It may be, that I ſhall never go to any other company, until I come to the Church and Congregation of the Firſt-born, whoſe names are written in Heaven. Art thou invited to the marriage of a friend? Say unto thy
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:41646:33" rendition="simple:additions"/>Soul, It may be I ſhall never go to any other Feaſt, but to the marriage of the Lamb offered from the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the World. Doſt thou ſee a rich and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Palace, or a pleaſant Garden? ſay to thy ſelf, It may be, I ſhall never ſee any other Palace, but that where the living God doth dwell, and it may be I ſhall never behold any other place of pleaſure, but the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtial Paradiſe.</p>
            <p>If thou doſt caſt down thy eyes to look upon the Earth, upon which thou doſt tread; Conſider at the ſame time, that this Earth, or ſome like to it, ſhall af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford thee a Grave, and that thou ſhalt ſleep there the ſleep of death: Remember what God told <hi>Adam, Duſt thou art, and to duſt thou ſhalt return,</hi> Gen. 3. or ſay with the Holy man <hi>Job. Remember I pray thee, that thou haſt formed me of Clay, and that thou ſhalt reduce me to duſt. I ſhall ſleep in the duſt, and if thou ſeekeſt for me in the morning, I ſhall be no more.</hi> Job 20. Job 7.</p>
            <p>If thou takeſt a view of the Plants, of the Herbs and Flowers; don't forget what the word of God ſpeaks concerning our Life, in the 90 <hi>Pſalm.</hi> That <hi>Man is like the Graſs which groweth up, in the morning it flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſheth and is green, in the evening it is cut down, and withereth.</hi> And in the 103 <hi>Pſalm.</hi> As for man his days <hi>are as Graſs, as a Flower of the field, ſo he flouriſheth, for the wind paſſeth over it, and it is gone, and the place there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ſhall know it no more.</hi> And elſewhere, <hi>All fleſh is like Graſs, and the Glory of Man like the Flower of the field.</hi> Iſ. 40. 1 Pet. 1.</p>
            <p>If thou doſt behold the Currants of Water, the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers and the Torrents; remember at that time what is ſaid in the 14 Chapter of the ſecond Book of <hi>Samuel, for we muſt needs dy, and are as water ſpilt on the ground.</hi> And in the 90 <hi>Pſalm. Thou carrieſt them away, as with a floud.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If thou tak'ſt notice of the ſhadow of the Needle in a Dyal that follows the ſwift motion of the Sun, or
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:41646:34" rendition="simple:additions"/>to the ſhadows which ſolid bodies caſt upon the Earth; In the evening they ſtretch a great way, and a little after vaniſh; conſider ſeriouſly, and engrave in thy mind this excellent <hi>Sentence. Man is like to vanity, his days are as a ſhadow that paſſeth away.</hi> Pſal. 144. and ſay as <hi>David, I am gone as the ſhadow when it decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth,</hi> Pſal. 109.</p>
            <p>If thou heareſt the roaring of the Winds, that God taketh out of his Storehouſes, Lift up thy Soul unto God thy Creator, and ſay with <hi>Job,</hi> Job 7. <hi>Remember that my life is but a wind, mine eye ſhall no more ſee good.</hi> Job 30. that is, the imaginary Good of this miſerable World. And elſewhere, <hi>Thou lifteſt me up to the wind, thou cauſeſt me to ride upon it, and diſſolveſt my ſubſtance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If thou takeſt any delight in the ſight of Birds that fly in the Air; Let this excellent thought enter into thy mind. <hi>My days are paſſed away, as the Eagle that haſteth to the prey,</hi> Job 9.</p>
            <p>If thou lookeſt up to the Glory and Beauty of the Heavens, and ſeeſt the raviſhing light of the Stars; conſider that thy God who hath form'd thee after his Image, is ſo good and noble, that he will not ſuffer thee to dwell for ever, or periſh amongſt this ſlimy and miſerable Earth, but to dwell with him for ever in the Heavens; and that at the end of thy Race, he will raiſe and carry thee into the Palace of his Glory, where thou ſhalt ſhine as the Sun in its greateſt ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor.</p>
            <p>If thou doſt meditate upon the changeableneſs of the ſeaſons, remember that the ſpring of thy infancy, the hot Summer of thy Youth, the Autumn of thy Maturity, and the ſad countenanc'd Winter of thy cold and decrepid age, ſhall ſucceed one another in the ſame order.</p>
            <p>Let him who travels by Land, think upon <hi>Job</hi>'s complaint, <hi>My days have been ſwifter than a Poſt, they flee away, they ſee no good, Job</hi> 9. Let him call to mind the

            <p>Let him who ſails upon the Sea, fancy the whole World as a great Sea toſt up and down with ſeveral furious Waves, our Life as a dangerous Voyage, and our Days as Ships, that paſs away in a moment; and let him conſider that the laſt breath of Death will drive us into the Haven of Eternal Felicity, to the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of immortal Glory, <hi>Job</hi> 9. Doth God bleſs us with Children? let us underſtand that we are minded by them of our Mortality, for they come to take our room, and to ſucceed to our Eſtate; Doth God take them away to his Reſt, and thoſe of whom we are moſt fond? Let this advertiſe us, That God intends thereby to cut off all the lower Roots, that tye us to this Earth, to unlooſe our hearts and affections, that we may offer them up to him alone. Inſtead of ſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our ſelves in Tears, and indulging our fooliſh hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour in needleſs diſpleaſures; Let us comfort our ſelves with this conſideration, That, by this means, a part of our ſelves is enter'd into Heaven, and that tother part will follow apace.

            <head>CHAP. 8. </head>
            <argument>
               <p>
                  <hi>The ſecond Remedy againſt the fears of Death, is to expect it at every hour.</hi>
               </p>
            </argument>
            <p>IT is not ſufficient to think often upon Death, and to diſcourſe of it in an excellent manner; for there be ſome that mention death very frequently, and with many pious reflexions; yet nevertheleſs they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not boaſt of being free from all apprehenſions of Death; their Tongue is always ready to ſpeak of Death, but their Heart cannot yield to expect it; they know that Death will ſeize upon them, but they entertain this dangerous opinion, that the time is not yet come; they acknowledge that they are indebted to God and Nature, but they delay the payment of the Debt from day to day, as if they were able to corrupt the Serje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants of Death, and obtain a Reprieve at their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. There is no man ſo old and decrepid, but flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters himſelf with the fancy of having yet at leaſt a year to live in the world. In ſhort, we imagine always, that we perceive Death at a vaſt diſtance from us, and that we ſhall ſoon enough fit our ſelves to receive it as we ought; therefore when ever, or where ever it comes to drag us out of the World, it ſurpriſeth and aſtoniſheth us.</p>
            <p>If we will prevent this miſchief, we muſt not only conſider that we are mortal, but that our life is ſhort and of no long continuance; we muſt continually ſay with <hi>Job, Are not my days few?</hi> Job 10. and imprint in our minds this Sentence of <hi>David, The Lord hath made my days as an hand-breath, mine age is as nothing before him, Pſal.</hi> 39. or that of <hi>Moſes, The beſt of our days are but labor and ſorrow, for they are ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> cut off, and we fly away,</hi> Pſal. 90.</p>
            <pb n="66" facs="tcp:41646:37" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p>The Antients painted <hi>Time</hi> with Wings, to expreſs its inevitable ſwiftneſs. The Holy Spirit compares our Life to a Weavers Shuttle, to an hired Servant, to a Poſt that runs apace, to a Packet-Boat, or to an Eagle that flies after its Prey. The Sacred Writers ſpeak of our Life, as of a Torrent of Waters, of a Cloud, a Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>por, a Wind, or a Breath: They tell us that our days are gone as a Dream, they fly away as a Shadow, they vaniſh as a Word in the Air, and that they periſh as a thought. In a word, all the Lightneſs and the moſt unconſtant things of the World, whereof the motion is very ſuddain and quick, are employed in Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to expreſs the vanity of our Life, and the ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of our days.</p>
            <p>Beſides that, our Life is of a ſhort continuance, it ſlides away inſenſibly, like to a Clock, the Wheels move without ceaſing, although the Hand appears to us to be ſteady; or to a Plant that grows continually, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the increaſe and growth is not to be diſcerned by our Eye-ſight, or like to a Man who ſtands in a Ship under Sail, he goes forward whither he will or no; Thus whether we Sleep or Wake, whether we Go of Lye down, whether we Eat or Faſt, whether we Work or Reſt, we proceed on continually forward towards our Grave; our Body is like a Tree eaten continually by Worms, for the day and the night feed upon it, without intermiſſion; in vain do ye baniſh out of your minds the thoughts of Death, if ye will not call it to your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance, it will not fail to mind and remember you; the more ye fly from it, the more it follows and purſues you at the heels, and when ye imagine Death to be fartheſt off from you, it is neareſt to you.</p>
            <p>As the Canker when it infects and enters into the Breaſt, it devours the Fleſh without interruption; ſo <hi>Time</hi> conſumes and devours us continually: The Meat that we ſwallow, and that nouriſheth us, brings us by degrees into the embraces of Death, as the Oil that
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:41646:37" rendition="simple:additions"/>cauſeth a Lamp to burn, leads it to its end; or as when a Torch is lighted, it begins to dye, aſſoon as it begins to burn; thus I may ſay without exceſs, that the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry firſt moment of this Animal Life, is the firſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our Death. As we ſay of all ſublunary Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, that the Generation of the one, is the Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the other: ſo is it with <hi>Time,</hi> The birth of an hour, of a day, of a week, of a moneth, or of a year, is the death of that which precedes; It is like a wheel, that mounts to no other end, but to fall down again.</p>
            <p>Seeing therefore that our Life is nothing elſe but a continued Death, in proper terms we are miſtaken to name only the moment of the ſeparation of the Soul and Body, the hour of death; for as when many Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non ſhot are diſcharg'd againſt a Caſtle, to open a breach, we don't ſay that the laſt hath done the work; or as when an hard ſtone is cut with Chiſwel and Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, or inſenſibly cav'd or undermin'd with Water, the laſt blow or drop don't carry away alone the glory of the performance: Thus when our Bodies decay and crumble away to duſt, we muſt not only conſider the laſt ſtruglings againſt Death, or the laſt attempt of this Enemy. Of a Ladder by which we aſcend and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend, we view every ſtop from the top to the bottom; Of an Hour-Glaſs we look to every grain of Sand; Of a Voyage or Journey, we reckon the firſt League, as well as the laſt; And in a Race, we take notice of the firſt ſtep that we go out, as well as of the laſt when we ſtop: Thus we muſt reckon our Death to begin from the firſt moment that we draw our breath, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til the laſt when we yield up the Ghoſt.</p>
            <p>Beſides what happens every moment to this poor and deſpicable nature, an infinite number of ſtrange, unwonted, and unexpected accidents, do ſtop and ſhorten our Race. The Taper is not always conſum'd by its own flame, many blaſts of wind and ſhowers of rain do extinguiſh it. If our Life is ſhort, it is no
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:41646:38"/>leſs weak and uncertain. The Body in which we lead a languiſhing life, is like <hi>Jonas</hi>'s Goard, for if it be but mov'd with a contrary and unwholſome blaſt, or toucht by an unhappy Worm, it withers upon a ſuddain, <hi>Jonas</hi> 4. This was the thought of <hi>Eliphas,</hi> when he ſaith, <hi>We dwell in houſes of Clay, our foundation is in the Duſt, we are cruſhed before the moth,</hi> Job 4. When God intends to deſtroy Mankind in his wrath, and kill multitudes in his diſpleaſure, he doth not always employ the agen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of Angels, as when he cut off all the firſt-born of the Land of Egypt, when he ſtretched forth the ſword of his vengeance upon <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and when he kill'd of <hi>Senacharib</hi>'s Army in one night, one hundred four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore and five thouſand Men; he doth not always let looſe the wicked Spirits, as when he gave them leave to raiſe a furious Tempeſt, which caſt to the ground the Houſe where <hi>Job</hi>'s Children were, and buried them in the ruines, <hi>Job</hi> 1. He doth not always open the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of Heaven, as when he waſh'd away the firſt wicked world with a fearful deluge, <hi>Gen.</hi> 7. He doth not always cauſe fire and brimſtone to rain from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, as he did upon <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah,</hi> upon <hi>Adma</hi> and <hi>Zeboim;</hi> he works not always miracles in the waters, as when he drown <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and his Egypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Hoſt in the waves of the Red Sea; He prepares not always Whales to devour us, as he did <hi>Jonas;</hi> He ſends not always burning Serpents, as to the murmuring Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of Iſraelites in the Deſarts; He commands not always the Earth to open and ſwallow us up, as it did <hi>Corah Dathan</hi> and <hi>Abiram;</hi> He ſends not always from above great Hailſtones, as when he knocks down the Amorites; He deſtroys us not always by flames that proceed from his preſence, as he did <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu,</hi> who offered unhallowed Fire upon his Altar; He Commands not always the Lions and the Bears of the Forreſt to iſſue out and devour us, as he did when the rebellious Prophet was kill'd, and when the ill-tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor'd
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:41646:38" rendition="simple:additions"/>Children of <hi>Bethel</hi> mockt <hi>Eliſha;</hi> In ſhort, God employs not always the Plagues and Judgements of Peſtilence, of War, and of Famin; the unpleaſant ſmell of a fuming Snuff, a flying vapor of malignant Smoak, is able to choak and kill us in a moment: A Fly, the Kernel of an Apple, an Hair of the Head, or the Seed of a Grape, or Aſhes, or Sand, or ſome other Atom, may ſtop the breath of our life. Therefore God advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth us by the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah, Ceaſe ye from Man whoſe breath is in his Noſtrils, for wherein is he to be accounted of?</hi> Iſai. 2.</p>
            <p>It is to be conſider'd that theſe miſchances happen very frequently, and in every place Death lays for us its ſnares, every where, as well in the boſom of our tender hearted Parents, and in the embraces of our deareſt friends, as amongſt the moſt barbarous and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage People, and amongſt our moſt inhumane Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; Its inviſible Darts fly up and down every where; and as the Pſalmiſt informs us, <hi>The peſtilence walketh in darkneſs, and deſtruction waſteth at noon-day.</hi> Pſal. 91. Death is as buſy on the ſolemn Feſtivals, as well as in the working days; it drags us as eaſily from the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, where we take our delights, as from the bed of Sorrow, where we ſigh and groan; there is no ſacred re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat where we may find a refuge, it hath no more regard of the Temples dedicated to Gods ſervice, than of the common houſes; All the Riches of <hi>America,</hi> and the power of the greateſt Monarchs, are not able to protect us from its purſuance; it requires a preſent payment of the debts that we owe; and it is not poſſible to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear by an Attorney, at the Summons that it ſends to us.</p>
            <p>Death claps not its warnings on the poſts of Doors, it thruſts them not into the hands of Meſſengers or Lacqueys; there is not one Summons, but it may write down upon it thoſe words, <hi>Speaking to him in Perſon:</hi> it ſurpriſeth us <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t home and abroad in our Cloſets, and
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:41646:39" rendition="simple:additions"/>in the Streets, in our Beds, in our Sedans, in the midſt of our Feaſts, and all our Pompe. It offers violence to the Sacred Perſon of the greateſt Kings, in their moſt ſumptuous Palaces, in their moſt flouriſhing Cities, and in their ſtrongeſt Fortifications, in the midſt of their moſt faithful ſubjects, and moſt victorious Armies, upon their Thrones, and in their triumphing Chariots. As King <hi>Ahab</hi> when he was going to take poſſeſſion of <hi>Naboth's</hi> Vineyard, told the Prophet <hi>Elijah</hi> in a rage, <hi>Thou haſt found me mine Enemy,</hi> 1 Kings 21. Thus when the prophane Worldlings dream of nothing but of the pleaſant enjoyment of their unjuſt poſſeſſions and of ſwimming in the Blood and Sweat of the meaner people, they meet unexpected Death, which they curſe in their hearts, and if it did not ſtop their mouths, they would ſay alſo in their rage, <hi>Haſt thou found me out mine Enemy?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Holy Meditation caus'd the wiſeſt King upon Earth to tell us, <hi>Man knoweth not his time, as the Fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es that are taken in an evil Net, and as the Birds that are caught in the ſnare, ſo are the Sons of Men ſnared in an evil time when it falls ſuddainly upon them,</hi> Eccl. 9.12. This ſame conſideration hath cauſed this excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Sentence to be written in the Book of <hi>Job; In a moment, ſhall they dye, and the people ſhall be troubled at midnight, and paſt away, and the mighty ſhall be taken away without hand,</hi> Job 34. That is, that to deſtroy Kingdoms and whole Nations, and to carry away the moſt luſty and mighty Men, Death hath no need of other aſſiſtance, but its own Arm.</p>
            <p>Do you deſire, Chriſtian Reader, the deſign of all this diſcourſe? Let me tell you then, that ſeeing Death is certain, and not to be avoided, and that there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo uncertain, as the hour of its arrival, we muſt ſo live as if we were to breathe forth the laſt gasp at every moment; We ſhould behave our ſelves, as if we had always our Souls upon our Lips, ready to yield them
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:41646:39" rendition="simple:additions"/>into the hands of our great Creator, and to ſpeak in <hi>Job</hi>'s Language, <hi>Having our Fleſh between our teeth, and our Souls in our hands,</hi> Job 13. Seeing that we know not at what time, nor in what place Death intends to come upon us, let us expect it at every moment, and in every place. Seeing that we lodge in this Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Tabernacle, without any loſs or aſſurance of Time; let us be ready to depart at the firſt warning; for it will be far better for us to goe out willingly than to be drag'd out againſt our wills; it is not convenient that Death ſhould carry us away in the ſame manner as the Sea bears and toſſeth a dead Corps upon its wayes; But we muſt in this occaſion imitate the diſcreet Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late or Mariner, that trims his Sails, and helps by his Art the Winds and the Tide, to drive him to his deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Haven: We ſhould not follow Death as the Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor follows the Executioner that leads him to ſuffer; but as the Child follows his Father that conducts him to a Feaſt; we ſhould not engage him in a combat with Death by conſtraint, as the antient Slaves did with the wild Beaſts in the Roman Amphitheaters; but we ſhould imitate <hi>David's</hi> generoſity, who, of his own accord, march'd out of the Camp of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> to fight with <hi>Goliah:</hi> It is better for us to attack and ſeize up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Death, than to be ſurprized and devoured by it unawares.</p>
            <p>Come when thou wilt, O Death! thou ſhalt never ſurprize me, for I wait for thee at every moment with my weapons ready in my hand; Thou ſhalt never drag me forcib<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>y, for I will follow thee willingly and joyfully; Although thou art mine Enemy, yet will I ſpeak to thee in the Language of the Spouſe, in the <hi>Canticles,</hi> to her beloved. <hi>Draw me and I will run after thee.</hi> Nay, I will meet thee in the way and receive thee with hearty embraces; for inſtead of dreading thy coming, I deſire it paſſionately, and hope for it; for at thy firſt arrival, aſſoon as I ſhall have ſeen thee, I

               <head>A Prayer and Meditation upon the continual expectation of Death.</head>
               <p>O <hi>Gracious God, in whoſe power alone, and at whoſe pleaſure are the Times and the Seaſons; I know that it is appointed to all men once to dye, and that the Grave is the dwelling which thou haſt prepared to receive all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; we underſtand ſufficiently by the experience of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Ages, that none is able to ſay,</hi> I ſhall live, and ſhall not ſee Death. <hi>Thou O Almighty God, our Supreme Judge haſt pronounced our irrevocable Sentence in the Earthly Paradiſe, that we muſt dye; ſo that I ſhould be guilty of the greateſt folly and madneſs, if I did not firmly believe that I muſt dye as others, and follow at my turn in the way of all fleſh: But Lord, thou haſt been pleaſed to hide from our knowledge, the wonderful proceedings of thy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, and doſt not ſuffer us to ſee the Hand that marks out the laſt hours of our Life: We can perceive no ſhadow to diſcover to us with certainty, when ſhall be the going down of our Sun; we know not at what hour of the day, or of the night, thou wilt call us away to appear before thy great Tribunal. Give us therefore Grace, O merciful God, to be alway ready to anſwer to thy Call, and to obey thy Holy Commands; that I may be as a Ship at Anchor, that ſtays only for a Wind to ſet her Sails forward; or as a Soldier who waits only for the Signal to march to the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter. Give me Grace, O good Lord, that I may be like the good and faithful Servant, who expects his Maſters coming, and hears his voice aſſoon as he calls; Or like the wiſe Virgins, who were ready to meet the Bridegroom, and to follow him into the Marriage Chamber, ſeeing that I
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:41646:40" rendition="simple:additions"/>can never know, neither the time nor the place, when Death will come to me. O that I might expect and wait for it at every moment, and at every place! O that I might live in ſuch a manner, as if I were always ready to dye. That my Soul were always upon my Lips, prepared to fly away. That I were continually in readineſs to commit it into thy hands. O my God, my Faithful and Merciful Creator. By this means I ſhall receive Death with Joy, when it comes as thy Servant and Meſſenger, and I ſhall follow it willingly, being certainly perſwaded that it will lead me in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Eternal Life, and introduce me into thy Glorious and Immortal Palace.</hi> Amen.</p>

            <argument>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Third Remedy againſt the fears of Death, is to conſider, that God hath appointed the time; and the manner of our Death.</hi>
               </p>
            </argument>
            <p>EIther we are Hypocrites, who draw near unto God with our Lips, and honor him with our Tongues, whilſt our Heart is far from him, <hi>Matth.</hi> 14. as we muſt deſire the accompliſhment of the Will of God, and reſigne our ſelves wholly to it, for every day we ſay to him in our Prayers, <hi>Thy will be done in Earth as it is in Heaven;</hi> Therefore we cannot abhor, nor fly from Death ſo cowardly, if we be right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perſwaded as we ought. That God hath limited the Time, and appointed the manner of our Death: That which moves us for the moſt part to complain of this laſt Enemy, is a continual eye that we have ſixed upon the Fleſh, and its Power, and a too great confidence upon ſecond cauſes. We are like the dog that bites at the ſtone that ſtrikes him, for we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly curſe the means that God employs to call and withdraw us out of the World.</p>
            <p>It will eaſily appear that God hath numbred our days, and that, by his wonderful and eternal Wiſdom, he hath decreed the hour and moment of every mans death; for beſides what our Saviour Chriſt ſaith in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, <hi>That God hath reſerv'd the Times and the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in his own power,</hi> Acts 1. <hi>Job</hi> tels us expreſly, <hi>The days of Man are determined, the number of his months are with thee, thou haſt appointed his bounds that he cannot
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:41646:43" rendition="simple:additions"/>paſs.</hi> Job 14. The Royal Prophet ſpeaks to the ſame purpoſe in the 31 Pſalm. <hi>I truſted in thee, O Lord, I ſaid, Thou art my God, my times are in thy hand.</hi> He is of the ſame judgement in the 39 <hi>Pſalm. Behold, thou haſt aſſured me my days as an band breadth.</hi> and in the 68 Pſalm, <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto God the Lord belong the iſſues of Death. Moſes</hi> teacheth us the ſame Leſſon in his Divine Hymn, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 90. for when he hath repreſented, how that it is God who reduceth Man to Aſhes, and maketh him return to his firſt ſubſtance; he tels us, ſpeaking unto God, <hi>Thou turneſt man to deſtruction, and ſayſt, return ye Children of Men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>King <hi>Hezekiah</hi>'s compariſon is very notable, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares the Life of Man to a Thread that God hath twiſted, and that he cuts off at his pleaſure, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 38. Mine Age is departed, and removed from me as a Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds Tent; I have cut off, like a Weaver, my life, he will cut me off with pining Sickneſs, from day even to night, wilt thou make an end of me. <hi>Hannah, Samu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els</hi> Mother removes all difficulty, and confirms this Truth ſufficiently, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. It is God, ſaith ſhe, who killeth and maketh alive, he bringeth down to the Grave, and bringeth up; There is nothing more ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficant to the ſame purpoſe than our Lord and Saviours words, <hi>I am he that liveth and was dead, and behold I am alive for evermore, Amen; and have the Keys of Hell and of Death,</hi> Apoc. This great God and Saviour cloſeth the Gates of the Grave when he pleaſeth, and 'tis not poſſible to open them againſt his will; In ſhort, <hi>Whether we live we live to the Lord, whether we die we die to the Lord, whether therefore we live or die, we are the Lords,</hi> Rom. 14.</p>
            <p>And our Reaſon being enlightned with a Divine Revelation, teacheth us this good and profitable Leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; for if God hath a hand in our Conception and Birth, and if he appoints the time of our entrance into the world, wherefore ſhould not he alſo have an hand
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:41646:43" rendition="simple:additions"/>in our Death, mark out the time of our laſt departure. <hi>David</hi> ſpeaks thus to God in the 139 <hi>Pſalm, My ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance was not bid from thee, when I was made in ſecret, and curiouſly wrought in the loweſt parts of the Earth. Thine eyes did ſee my ſubſtance, yet being imperfect and in thy Book, all my Members were written, which in continuance, were faſhioned, when as yet there is none of them;</hi> we may therefore for the ſame reaſon, ſay to God, My ſubſtance will not be hid from thee, when this miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Body ſhall fall to pieces, as rotten Wood, and as a Moth-eaten Garment; thine Eyes ſhall ſee me, when Death ſhall cut off the Thred of my Life, and ſeparate what thou haſt joyned together, ſo wonderfully thy Power and Wiſdom ſhall have an hand in my laſt hours, and nothing ſhall happen to me, but that which thou haſt afore ordained in thine unſearchable Decrees.</p>
            <p>If God appoints the time of our Reſurrection, and if it be certain, that without his expreſs Commiſſion, the Holy Spirit will not breathe upon our dead bones, to cauſe them to revive; is it probable that the breath ſhould depart out of our Noſtrils, and our Bodies ſhould fall into the Bed of corruption, without the Orders of this great and living God? <hi>Ezek.</hi> 37. He hath appointed to the Sun its courſe, and to the Stars that ſhine in the Heavens, their ſeveral motions and ſtations, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 40 and ſhould not he alſo appoint to his Children their moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſeeing that they are to ſhine for ever in the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of Heavens, where juſtice dwels, as ſo many im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal Stars He hath meaſured the Waters in his hand, he hath compaſſed the Heavens with his Span, he hath weighed the Mountains in Scales, and the Hills with a Ballance, he hath faſhioned the Earth with a Hive, and given bounds to the roaring Sea; and is it poſſible that he hath not not meaſured the time of our Life, and that he hath marked out with his finger the laſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? He who hath numbred the Kingdoms of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Princes, hath he not alſo numbred the days in the
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:41646:44" rendition="simple:additions"/>which he intends to reign in our hearts by his Holy Spirit; hath he not appointed the time for us to aſcend up into the higheſt Heavens, where we are to reign with him in the Kingdom of his Glory.</p>
            <p>If it be certain that God hath unmbred the Hairs of our Head, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10. it is not to be doubted, but that he hath alſo numbred the days of our Life. And if a Sparrow doth not fall to the ground without his order, how can it be that a Soul ſhould take its flight up to Heaven without his expreſs Commiſſion? He bottles up our Tears, he keeps a Record of all our afflictions, and takes an account of our Sorrows, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50. and can we imagine that he doth not keep an account of the life and death of Men, and that he minds not the time that we are to ſpend in this vally of Tears. He takes notice of our upriſing, and of our down-ſitting, he compaſſeth thee round about whither thou doſt ſtop or go, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 59. and can it be conceiv'd, but that he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves thy riſing at thy birth, the ſeveral paſſages of thy Life, and thy going down at thy Death?</p>
            <p>In ſhort, if God hath appointed in his eternal Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, the continuance of the great World; he hath alſo, without doubt, limited the Life of Man, the little World, and the Image, and Compendium of the Great As our Lord and Saviour teacheth us, Man is not able by his ſolicitous care to add one Cubit to his ſtature; and our experience ſufficiently demonſtrates, that we cannot add a year, a day, nor a moment, by all our labor and induſtry, to the continuance of our Life.</p>
            <p>If Life and Death were not in Gods hand, there would be nothing ſetled, nor conſtant, neither in the Kingdoms of the World, nor in the Church of Chriſt. The Prophets would be often found in grievous errors, and the eternal Election, would be totally aboliſh'd; for the moſt weighty affairs of a Commonwealth, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon the Life of Princes. The death of one Man is able to turn an Empire upſide down, and to change
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:41646:44" rendition="simple:additions"/>the ſtate of a Kingdom. If <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great had been ſtifled in his Cradle, what would become of the Propheſie of <hi>Pani<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>If the Devil could have taken away St. Pauls Life, before his journy to <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> where he was ſtrangly converted by a Miracle; how could Gods immutable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree be accompliſh'd? for he had deſigned him from his Mothers Womb, to be a Noble Veſſel of his Grace and Mercy, and a faithful Ambaſſador of his Son, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. If the good Thief had died before he had ſeen the Light, or if he had been kill'd in one of his Robberies, how could he have been converted upon the Croſs, where he Repented of his Crimes? Or how could he have heard from our Saviour theſe bleſſed and comfortable words? <hi>Verily I ſay unto thee, Thou ſhalt be with me this day in Paradiſe,</hi> Luke 31.</p>
            <p>The Heathens have perceiv'd and underſtood this Truth, but they have darkened and defaced it by their impertinent and ridiculous Fictions, for their Poets tell us, that there are three <hi>Parcae,</hi> or infernal Goddeſſes, the one holds the Diſtaff and Spins, the other winds up the Thred, the third cuts it, and puts a period there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to the Life of Man. By this Fable they intend to teach us, that God lengthens or ſhortens at his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure Mans Life. As it is therefore certain, that God hath
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:41646:45" rendition="simple:additions"/>numbred our days; he hath alſo appointed, in his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Wiſdom, the means to convey us out of the world. If one dieth in Peace, another is kill'd in War; If one departs in his Bed, another hangs upon a Gib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet; If one periſheth by Famine, and another is ſtifled with the Plague; If one is ſtruck with the Thunder, and the other is torn in pieces by wild Beaſts; If one is choak'd in the Waters, and the other periſheth in the Flames; In ſhort, if the ſeparation of the Soul from the Body, happens in a different manner, it is not without the expreſs Leave and Orders of our Heavenly Father; Therefore when we ſee the ſtrangeſt accidents come to paſs, and the moſt unexpected and tragick Deaths before our Eyes; We muſt remember the ſaying of the Prophet <hi>Jeremy,</hi> when he ſaw the burning and plunder of <hi>Jeruſalem, Who is he that ſaith, and it cometh to paſs when the Lord commandeth it not? out of the mouth of the moſt high proceedeth not evil and good?</hi> Sam. 3. We muſt then conſider with the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> That it is God that creates the Light and the Darkneſs, and that ſends Proſperity and Adverſity, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 15.45. Or with <hi>Amos,</hi> who enquires whither <hi>there be any evil in the City and the Lord hath not done it,</hi> Amos 3. That is to ſay, that there is no Affliction, nor Death that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens, but God hath appointed it, and fore-ordain'd it by his wiſe providence. If the Devil cannot deſtroy <hi>Job</hi>'s Flocks of Sheep, nor hurry headlong into the Sea the Herds of Swine without his leave, who holds him faſt in Chains, <hi>Matt.</hi> 8. Let us perſwade our ſelves that all the powers of Hell and the World, cannot cauſe us to dye by a violent Death, if God hath not ordain'd it before in the reſolutions of his infinite Wiſdom; ſo that if at any time a Prince or a Magiſtrate ſpeaks to us in Pilats language to our Saviour, <hi>Knoweſt thou not that I have power to crucify thee, and power to ſave thee,</hi> John 19. being ſtrengthened with an Holy Confidence, Let us anſwer him as our Saviour. <hi>Thou ſhouldeſt not
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:41646:45" rendition="simple:additions"/>have that power over me, were it not given to thee from above.</hi> Without the leave and pleaſure of my God, thou canſt not take from me an Hair of my Head.</p>
            <p>We read in the Book of <hi>Judges,</hi> that when <hi>Abime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lech</hi> aſſaulted the Tower of <hi>Thebez,</hi> with a reſolution to win it; upon a ſuddain, a Woman caſt from the top a piece of a Milſtone, that fell upon his Head and broke his Scull, <hi>Judg.</hi> 9. If we look only upon the ſecond Cauſes, this accident may appear to be ſtrange, and unexpected, but we muſt lift up our Eyes to the Almighty hand of an al-ſeeing Power and Wiſdom, far more dextrous than that of this poor Woman: for the ſame Relation declares, That God by this means brought to paſs <hi>Jotham's</hi> Prophecy, and <hi>rendred the wickedneſs of Abimelech which he did unto his Father in ſlaying the ſeventy Brethren with his mercileſs hand,</hi> upon his own guilty head.</p>

               <hi>Ahab</hi> King of <hi>Iſrael</hi> was diſguiſed with a deſigne, to fight with the Syrians, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 22. An unknown Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier lets fly by chance an Arrow out of his Bow, which ſtruck him in the weakeſt part of his Armor, wounded him to death, and the Dogs lickt the Blood that guſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of his Wounds: At this ſight a carnal and an earthly Mind will ſay, That this was but a miſchance of War, an unfortunate accident; But the Spirit of God informs us better, that this happen'd to fulfil the Prophecy of <hi>Elias,</hi> and the dreadful threatnings which he had pronounced againſt this wicked Prince, who labor'd, by Tyrannical and deviliſh attempts, to invade other mens Poſſeſſions; <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, in the place where Dogs licked the blood of Naboth, ſhall Dogs lick thy blood, even thine,</hi> 1 Kings, 21.</p>
            <p>When we caſt our eyes upon the Tragical death of <hi>Joſias,</hi> King of <hi>Juda,</hi> at the firſt ſight it appears, but the effect of the boiling fury of Youth, which car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried him againſt all reaſon, obſtinately to fight with <hi>Pharaoh Neco</hi> King of <hi>Egypt,</hi> or of the ſtrength and

But to underſtand the Truth we muſt enter farther into the Sanctuary, and adore the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Gods Decree, that had reſolved to take away this good and religious Prince, into his Eternal Reſt, and beſtow upon him a more noble and a richer Crown, before he took in hand the ſword of his vengeance, to puniſh the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> for the many Idolatries, and horrid Crimes, of which they had been guilty: By this means God fulfilled the Prophecy of <hi>Huſda, Behold, I will gather thee unto thy Fathers, and thou ſhalt be gathered into thy Grave in peace, and thine eyes ſhall not ſee all the evil which I will bring upon this place,</hi> 2 Kings 22.</p>
            <p>When we look upon the Death and Paſſion of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, we may imagine at the firſt view, that only the Phariſees envy, <hi>Judas</hi>'s Treaſon, the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiny of the rude Rabble, Pilates Injuſtice, Herods Jeſts, and the cruelty of the Roman Soldiery, were the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of his Tragedy; but the Holy Apoſtles <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> unto whom our Saviour had diſcover'd the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt ſecrets of his Wiſdom, conſider theſe outward Agents but as the Inſtruments to bring Gods great deſigne, Mans redemption to paſs. Therefore they ſpeak of it in this manner, in the fourth of the <hi>Acts, Againſt thine Holy Child, Jeſus whom thou haſt anointed, both Herod and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles and the people of Iſrael were gathered together, to do whatſoever thine Hand and thy Counſel determined before to be done.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If it happens by miſchance, that a friend ſtrikes an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, for example, If in a Wood where they are fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of it, the head of the Axe ſhould ſlip out of the

But God declares in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs terms, That he cauſeth ſuch an one to happen under the hand of his friend that kill'd him againſt his will: To ſecure the innocent Author of the unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected Murther, God appointed Cities of Refuge for ſuch to fly to, <hi>Numb.</hi> 35.</p>
            <p>As when the hour of our Death is come, all the Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of the world cannot pay our Ranſome, all the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the moſt prudent Councils, nor ſtrength of a Kingdom, are not able to free us from the power of death, On the contrary, when it pleaſeth God to ſhelter and preſerve our Life, all the ſubtilty and cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Devil, all the power and fury of the world cannot take it from us.</p>

               <hi>Eſau</hi> in his rage, full of vengeance and diſpleaſure a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his Brother, reſolves to kill him; on purpoſe to accompliſh this cruel deſigne he goes to meet him with four hundred Men; But God who holds in his hand the hearts of all the Men of the World, God that diſſolves the ſtony Rocks into Fountains of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and the Stones into Rivers of Oil, forced out of this hardened heart Tears of Compaſſion and Love.

This great and Soveraign Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch of the whole World, who draws Light out of Darkneſs, made uſe of their moſt damnable malice and hatred, to accompliſh his good purpoſe, and to raiſe his Servant to a conſiderable d gree of Honor and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, which was prepared for him: Theſe inhumane
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:41646:47" rendition="simple:additions"/>Souls, full of envy and diſpleaſure, did conſpire toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, how to hinder the fulfilling of <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s Dreams; but contrary to their intention they made way, and were inſtrumental to the accompliſhment of that which God had revealed to his Prophet; Therefore when his Brethren were afraid leſt he ſhould revenge himſelf up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, when he had power in his hand, he anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them with an heart full of Charity and Love, <hi>Am I in the place of God, as for you ye thought evil againſt me, but God meant it unto good,</hi> Gen. 50.</p>

In the Wilderneſs of <hi>Mahon,</hi> King <hi>Saul</hi> had ſurrounded him with his Men on every ſide, ſo that no help nor ſuccour was to be expected from Man, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23. but by a wonderful Providence God deliver'd him, for when he was ready to be caught, a Meſſenger comes to inform <hi>Saul, Make haſte and come, for the Philiſtines are enter'd into thy Land;</hi> So that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the inhumane perſecutions of this Tyrant, nor the abominable plotting of his unnatural Son, nor the Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults and Revolts of his People; nor the moſt furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Tempeſts of Hell and the World, have ever bin able to extinguiſh his Life before the time appointed; when he had ſpent all the days allotted to him by Gods good providence, he fell aſleep as a Man that lays him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf down to reſt quietly, after a long and laborious Task.</p>
            <p>Queen <hi>Jezabel</hi> was enraged againſt the Prophet <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jah,</hi> ſhe had ſworn by her Gods, that he ſhould ſurely be put to death; but by a miracle, God kept him out of the bloody hands of this incarnate Devil; and by another Miracle he preſerved from Famine and Hunger, him whom he had before preſerved from <hi>Jezabels</hi> Sword and Fury; he ſent the Ravens to feed him with
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:41646:47" rendition="simple:additions"/>Bread and Meat, morning and evening; and for his ſake God increas'd the Widow of <hi>Sarepta</hi>'s Oil and Meal; when he was ready to be famiſh'd in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, he diſpatch'd an Angel to him, to carry him Meat and Drink. In ſhort, all the ſtorms that the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil raiſed againſt him, could not deſtroy his Life, ſo that when God reſolv'd to crown his Labors, he fetch'd him in a Chariot of Fire, and carried him up into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
            <p>The Syrians were reſolved to take the Prophet <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſha,</hi> becauſe that he diſcover'd the moſt ſecret Counſels, and fruſtrated all their deſignes, therefore they beſieg'd the Town of <hi>Dotan,</hi> to ſeize upon this Man of God; When his Servant beheld the dreadful number of Horſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es and Chariots that ſurrounded that weak City, he cryed out in a fright, Alas, Maſter what ſhall we do? and he anſwered, Fear not, for they that be with us, are more then they that be with them, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 6. At theſe words of <hi>Eliſha,</hi> the eyes of the poor Man were open'd, and he ſaw an innumerable company of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riots of Fire, and Horſes of Fire, that God had ſent from Heaven, to guard his Servant the Prophet.</p>
            <p>The Jews did often plot againſt our Saviour Chriſt, and attempt to kill him, <hi>John</hi> 10.

            <p>If we did but examine the Memorials of our fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers, and conſider the things that we have ſeen with our Eyes, and experienced from our Infancy, we ſhould find, that the means which God hath employed, and which he doth daily employ for our deliverance, are no leſs wonderful then thoſe of former ages; God's Arm is not ſhortened, his Almighty Power is not leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſened, he hath yet as much Authority as ever upon Men and Devils, and his Divine Providence is no leſs watchful for the preſervation of ſuch as fear and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip him; If we had the Eyes of the Soul as open as the Eyes of our Body, or if we could but perceive the things that are of themſelves inviſible, we ſhould ſee that God looks upon us continually with the Eye of his Love, and of his Fatherly care, and that he co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers us with his hand, as with a Buckler of proof, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all the Darts of the World and of Hell; We ſhould ſee that we are encompaſſed about with a Wall of Fire, and that the Holy Angels do guard us on every ſide. We ſhould then acknowledge, that it is God that holdeth our Soul in Life, and ſuffereth not our Feet to be moved, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 66. And we ſhould cry out as <hi>David, O God, who is like unto thee? thou who haſt ſhewed me great and ſore troubles, ſhalt quicken me again, and bring me up again from the depths of the Earth; Thou ſhalt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe my greatneſs, and comfort me on every ſide,</hi> Pſal. 71.</p>
            <p>Although this wholſome and moſt uſeful Doctrine, be plainly taught in Holy Writ, and ſufficiently confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by ſo many examples out of the Word of God; ſome there are that oppoſe it with many needleſs ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections.</p>
            <p>In the firſt place they ſay, That God promiſeth length of days to ſuch Children as ſhall be obedient to their Fathers and Mothers; from whence they think to infer, that our Life hath no certain time limited,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:41646:49" rendition="simple:additions"/>and that it is prolong'd or ſhortned, as we prove obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient or diſobedient to God, and his Holy Laws; There is no difficulty to give an anſwer to this Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:</p>
            <p>That in the Language of the Holy Spirit, the word that ſignifies there <hi>to prolong,</hi> means not always to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a thing longer then it was, or ſhould be, but only to make it of a long continuance; ſo that God doth not promiſe here, that the Children who ſhall obey his Sacred Laws, ſhall enjoy a longer life, than otherwiſe it ought to be, but only that he will do them the favor to live long and happily in the World: We may prove this Expoſition by <hi>St. Pauls</hi> words, who paraphraſes this firſt Commandment of the ſecond Table, in this manner, <hi>Children obey your Fathers and Mothers in the Lord, for it is juſt, Honor thy Father and thy Mother, which is the firſt Commandment, with promiſe, that it may be well with thee, and that thou mayeſt live long upon the Earth:</hi> This promiſe is to be underſtood with ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception; If God ſhould judge it expedient for his Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and for the good of his Children; for there are many pious and obedient Children, whom God with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draws out of the World, in the flower of their Age, to give them an happier life, which ſhall have no other limits than Eternity.</p>
            <p>In the next place, they alledge the remarkable Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of King <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> unto whom <hi>Iſaiah</hi> was ſent with this meſſage; <hi>Set thine houſe in order, for thou ſhalt dye and not live:</hi> Nevertheleſs God was intreated by his Prayers and Tears, and prevail'd upon to ſuffer him to live longer; therefore the Prophet told him, that God had added 15 years to his days. To this Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on I anſwer,</p>
            <p>That according to the ordinary courſe of the World, and the diſpoſition of the natural Cauſes, <hi>Hezekiah</hi> was to dye of that diſeaſe, for the Scripture ſaith ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly, <hi>That Hezekiah</hi> was ſick unto Death; That is
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:41646:49" rendition="simple:additions"/>to ſay, that this diſeaſe was mortal, in regard of the ſecond Cauſes, and the ordinary courſe of Nature; Therefore theſe words, <hi>Set thine houſe in order, for thou ſhalt dye and not live,</hi> ought to be underſtood with this exception; Thou ſhalt dye if I don't deliver thee by a miracle, and if I don't employ mine Almighty Power to heal thee, and reſtore unto thee thy former health.</p>
            <p>This may be alſo underſtood in another manner, Thou ſhalt dye if thou doſt not repent and turn unto me with Prayers and Tears. In the ſame ſence God cauſed it to be proclaim'd in the ſtreets of <hi>Ninivy, within forty days Ninivy ſhall be deſtroyed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let not any man conclude from hence, that <hi>Heze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah</hi>'s repentance was the cauſe of the lengthening of his days; and therefore that it was a caſualty very uncertain. On the contrary, we may underſtand, that God who had appointed by his Eternal Decree, that this Wiſe and Religious Prince, ſhould live more than the diſpoſition of his Body would ſuffer him, had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo reſolved to draw from his Heart Sighs, and Groans, and Tears from his Eyes, for God knew all his Works from Eternity. <hi>Acts</hi> 1.</p>
            <p>Others do argue againſt this Doctrine more imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinently; That if God hath numbred our days, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed to our life its bounds, that it is in vain to take ſo much pain, and make ſo much ado about Bodies di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper'd with a ſickneſs, and that it is to little purpoſe to adminiſter any Remedy to them, or to pray for the recovery of their health. In like manner, ſuch may af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, that it is to no purpoſe to eat or drink, and to hinder the mad perſons from caſting themſelves down a Precipice, or from ſwallowing poiſon, becauſe they ſhall live neither more nor leſs, than God hath ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from all Eternity. This Objection may ſeem very plauſible at the firſt, although it be moſt abſurd and ſo fooliſh, that it muſt needs proceed from a great igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance or malice; for it is not to be doubted, that when
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:41646:50" rendition="simple:additions"/>any doth aime at one end, he deſignes and ſuppoſes, by conſequence to attain unto it, by the ordinary means. For example, God had appointed in his Eternal Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, to preſerve <hi>Jacob</hi> and his Family, from that furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Famine, that rag'd the ſpace of ſeven years; in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, to that end he ſends <hi>Joſeph</hi> into <hi>Aegypt,</hi> to gather up Proviſion the ſeven years of plenty. <hi>Iſaiah</hi> the Prophet had told <hi>Hezekiah</hi> from God, that he ſhould live the ſpace of fifteen years more; therefore he Commanded to apply to this Prince's Sores and Boils, a lump of dried Figs: God had promiſed to <hi>David,</hi> that he ſhould be King over the Houſe of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> to confirm this promiſe, he had been anointed with Oil by the Prophet <hi>Samuel.</hi> This promiſe don't hinder him from ſeeking the means to preſerve himſelf from a <hi>Sauls</hi> unjuſt purſuance. And when <hi>Nathan</hi> tels him that God had decreed to eſtabliſh his Poſterity upon his Throne after him, this don't ſtop his Prayers, or cool his Devotion; on the contrary, it was that which did quicken him the more, and enſlame his Soul with Love and Thankfulneſs to God, therefore he expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth himſelf in this manner, <hi>O Lord of Hoſts, God of Iſrael, thou haſt revealed to thy Servant, ſaying, I will build thee an houſe, therefore hath thy ſervant found in his heart to pray this Prayer unto thee, &amp;c.</hi> 2 Sam. 7.</p>
            <p>Our Lord Jeſus Chriſt knew for certain all that ſhould happen to him; nevertheleſs we find him ſpending the days and the nights in Prayer, and when his life was in danger, he did not neglect the lawful and harmleſs means. He told his Apoſtles, <hi>Are not two Sparrows ſold for a farthing? and one of them ſhall not fall to the ground without your Father, but the very hairs of your head are all numbred.</hi> This conſideration hinders him, not from Commanding them, that when they are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted in one City, they ſhould fly to another.</p>

            <p>It is without reaſon, that ſome bring the Hiſtory of King <hi>Aſa,</hi> againſt this undoubted Truth; Such affirm that this Prince was reproved for ſeeking to the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitians in his ſickneſs: Theſe are the words of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scripture, <hi>Aſa in the thirty ninth year of his Reign, was diſeaſed in his feet, until his diſeaſe was exceeding great, yet in his diſeaſe he ſought not to the Lord, but to the Phyſitians,</hi> 2 Chron. 1. The Spirit of God doth not blame this Prince, becauſe he deſired the aſſiſtance of Phyſitians, but becauſe he did not ſeek help from God, nor did not implore his aid in the day of his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs. He that is ſick, may as freely take Phyſick, as he that is well may eat and drink; I confeſs, we muſt not altogether repoſe our confidence and truſt upon the Remedies, but rather upon God, who ſends both ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and health; As Man doth not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds from the mouth of God; ſo it is not by the Phyſick alone that a Patient is cured of his diſtemper, but by the Bleſſing and Power of him who gives the wound, and binds it up, who ſtrikes and heals when he pleaſeth, <hi>Job</hi> 5. Therefore as we ought never to eat nor drink before we pray unto God to vouchſafe his Bleſſing upon our Meat and Drink, that he may grant to them the vertue of recruiting the decayed ſtrength of our Bodies; likewiſe we ſhould never take any Phyſick, without lifting up our hands unto God for a bleſſing, that the Remedy may have the ſtrength to expel our Diſeaſe. All Gods Creatures are
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:41646:51" rendition="simple:additions"/>good, when they are received with thanksgiving, for they are ſanctified by the word of God and by Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.</p>
            <p>Take notice here, how much ſuch perſons are to be blamed, who when they lament for the loſs of their friends or kindred, inſtead of looking up to Heaven, look down upon the Earth, and conſider nothing but the inferior cauſes of their diſpleaſure; inſtead of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doring and ſubmitting with all humility, to the wiſe Providence of God, that diſpoſeth of all worldly events, and appoints the meaneſt circumſtances, they fret and murmure, they delight to nouriſh in their minds, grief and diſpleaſure, that conſumes them, and break forth into many needleſs complaints, that ſerve but to open their wounds, and to render them more miſerable; If he had not been in ſuch a place, if he had not been engag'd in ſuch a way, if ſuch a Phyſitian had not been call'd, or if another had been ſent for, if this or that had not been done, if this Phyſick had not been admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred to him, if leſs or more Blood had been taken from him, if he had been ſuffer'd to eat more meat, or if leſs had been given, my Brother or my Siſter, my Wife, my Child, or my Husband, had been yet alive, It may be thou art miſtaken <hi>Friend;</hi> the Diſeaſe could not be cur'd but by a Miracle, but when it ſhould be otherwiſe, we muſt nevertheleſs lift up our Eyes to God, and acknowledge his finger with all reverence, for oft times he blinds the Phyſitians, ſo that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not underſtand the nature of the Diſeaſe, and ſuffers them to apply Remedies contrary to the diſtemper; As God threatens to take away the ſtaff of Bread, that is to ſay, the nouriſhing ſtrength and vertue of the Bread; <hi>Levit.</hi> 26. likewiſe he takes away his Bleſſing from the moſt Soveraign Remedies, and renders them altogether uſeleſs; it is thus with all the other accidents that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to us, and that bring us to our Graves, for when it plaſeth him to remove any body out of the World,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:41646:51" rendition="simple:additions"/>he ſuffers him to ſhut his eyes to all the light of Reaſon and Prudence, and to caſt himſelf away headlong into the moſt apparent dangers; as when he deſigned to deſtroy <hi>Abſalom,</hi> and to cut him off, he cauſed him to be led away by evil Council, and diſappointed the diſcreet and prudent advice of <hi>Achitophel.</hi> Therefore, ſeeing that God hath appointed or fore-ordain'd before man's Creation, the time and manner of his Death, at what hour, in what place, and by what means ſoever God calls away our friends, or ſtrikes at our perſons, it is always our Duty to poſſeſs our Souls with patience, and not to ſuffer the leaſt repining, and deſpairing word to creep out of our mouths.</p>
            <p>If Death ſuddainly ſnatcheth away thy deareſt Children, or thy moſt intimate friends, complain not of its inhumanity. Remember that it doth put in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution the decrees of Gods everlaſting Will, and that it carries with it a Commiſſion ſealed with the Signet of the living God.

            <p>I don't wiſh thee to have an Heart of Flint, without natural affection; Piety and Religion are not barbarous, they don't deprive us of our Bowels; the affection that thou beareſt to thy Children is not diſpleaſing to the Father of Mercies, if it be but well govern'd, and don't exceed the natural bounds; It is lawful for thee to be ſenſible of their griefs, to weep for their diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, and to pray for the recovery of their health; But when God hath diſpos'd of them, and receiv'd them into his Eternal Reſt, thou muſt ſtop all thy Sighs, wipe all thy Tears, and ſay as <hi>David</hi> did, after the death of his beloved Child, <hi>We ſhall go to them, but they ſhall not come to us.</hi> 2 Sam. 12.</p>

Here I am at a diſtance not only from my natural ſoil and fare, from the pleaſant company of my friends, and deprived of all ſpiritual Comfort, of which I have at preſent greateſt need in my extremity, but alſo, to my unſpeakable grief, here I am in a barbarous Countrey, in the hands of my moſt inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane and unreconcileable Enemies; I have no body to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and rejoyce me, nor to ſtrengthen me in the faith of my Saviour Chriſt; all things that appear before me, do increaſe and add to my trouble: I am here among the Enemies of the Truth, who labour to deſtroy my intereſt in Chriſt, and to cauſe me to periſh, now that I am entering into the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of Eternity I muſt encounter with Death, with Hell it ſelf, and with the ſubtle inſinuations of the infernal Spirits. O Almighty and merciful Lord, ſuffer me not to loſe courage and to yield to the preſent temptations. By thy wonderful Providence, and out of the Treaſuries of thy Mercy, ſupply all my wants and infirmities, and grant that I may with the Shield of faith, quench all the ſiery Dorts of the Devil. I am beſet with many viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and inviſible Enemies, but they that are for me, are more in number then they that are againſt me: It is true, I am far from my Native Countrey, but I am not one jott farther from Heaven, whereof the Earth is the Center; I am at a diſtance from all my Earthly friends, but nothing can put me at a diſtance from thee; O good God, who lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt me with an unchangeable affection; I am in the imbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of mine Heavenly Father, and of my God, I have not the comfort of a Miniſter to aſſiſt and help me in my grief and pain, but I know that thou wilt ſend to me thine Holy Angels, as once to thy beloved Son, in his bitter Agony; Theſe Angels ſhall protect me againſt all the power of the Prince of darkneſs; Thou wilt adminiſter unto me thy ſelf, the ſweet comforts of thy Salvation; thy Rod and thy Staff will aſſiſt me in this Valley, and Shadow of Death.

Lord my God, I muſt needs acknowledge, that I have grievouſly offended thee, ſeeing thou doſt thus chaſtiſe me with ſo much ſeverity, and
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:41646:57" rendition="simple:additions"/>makeſt me to feel ſo ſharp an affliction; I am unworthy of all thy favors, ſeeing thou doſt take from me ſuch a preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous jewel which was ſhewn to me as a Lightning. I am afraid to have been wanting in my Duty, and that this death that kills me, is the effect of my ſtupidity and blindeſs: Methinks I could have hinder'd this doleful accident, for if I had behav'd my ſelf otherwiſe than I have done, my Life and Soul ſhould not be now in its Grave. O God of all comfort, pardon my exceſſive grief, pacify my ſighs, ſtop the currant of my Tears, remove all theſe vain diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures that conſume me, deliver my Soul from this unmer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful, grief and torment, that it ſuffers, and from theſe troubles that are more than humane: Inſtead of looking to theſe inferior Cauſes, and to the circumſtances of the death of this perſon, that I did love as mine own Soul; give me grace to remember, that the leaſt things as well as the greateſt, are govern'd and rul'd by thy wiſe Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and that the good and the evil proceed from thy Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine appointment. Give me Grace to conſider, that thou doſt hold in thine Almighty hand, the Keys of Life and Death, and that thou alone doſt caſt us into the Grave, and lift us up from thence again. Thou, O Soveraign Monarch of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal World, who doſt not only let death looſe, but doſt alſo appoint all the means to talke us out of the World; make me truly ſubmiſſive unto thy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Pleaſure, and to put the Finger upon my Lips, becauſe it is thy doing; If I open them, let it be to adore thy Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, and ſing forth thy Praiſes; the perſon for whom I lament ſo much, was nearly related to me, like another my ſelf, but it was alſo thy Creature, thy Child, and a Member of our Saviours myſtical Body. We for our parts believe, to have the right of diſpoſing of our Workman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and of that which we have bought with our Money; and haſt not thou, O God, the liberty to diſpoſe of that which thou haſt created after thy likeneſs? bought, not with corruptible things, as with Gold and Silver, but by the precious Blood of the Lamb, without ſpot or blemiſh. Thou
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:41646:57" rendition="simple:additions"/>hadſt a Son who is the brightneſs of thy Glory, and the expreſs image of thy perſon, whom thou haſt not ſpared for me, and ſhall I Lord refuſe thee my Heart and my Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els? Thy only begotten Son came down upon Earth to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fer the moſt cruel and ignominious Death of the Croſs, but thou haſt taken up into Heaven the perſon whom my ſoul did love, to crown it with a glorious and ever happy Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality; Shall his or her Felicity be the cauſe of my Miſery? and that his or her Reſt occaſion my diſpleaſure? It is the property of true love to prefer the happineſs of the beloved Perſons, to our own ſatisfactions; Therefore our Saviour told his Apoſtles; If you did love me, you would rejoyce, becauſe I go to my Father, for my Father is greater than I. Between thee, O great and living God, and us miſerable Worms of the Earth, there is a vaſt difference, as there is between the innocent and harmleſs delights of this world, and the unſpeakale pleaſures of thy preſence; for theſe are but as drops of Water, that are dried up with the leaſt wind; whereas the ſatisfactions of Heaven are like a bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomleſs Sea of Delights, in which we ſhall ſwim for ever. Do I therefore weep for him or for her, whoſe tears thou haſt wip'd away? Do I wear a mourning Apparel, and a black Scarf, for him who is now cover'd with a Glorious Attire of Joy and Gladneſs, and who is adorned with an Habit as white as Snow? Do I delight my ſelf in darkneſs, and doth he ſolace himſelf at the Fountain of Light and Glory? Do I ſeek a ſolitary and melancholly Retreat, and doth he rejoyce amongſt the thouſands of Angels, and the Glorious company of the immortal Spirits? I ſigh and groan, and he ſings a new ſong, the Song of the Bleſſed, which is always in his mouth. All my complaints and groanings cannot bring him back upon Earth; but when that were poſſible, it is not juſt to attempt it; my kindneſs would be cruel, and my love moſt inhumane: How could I reſolve to make him leave the Haven of Eternal Felicity, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe him again to the furious Waves and ſtorms of this troubleſom Sea of the World? How can I have the heart to

Can I be ſo cruel to pluck him from thy boſom, from the Breaſts of thy moſt tender favours, and from that fulneſs of Joy, which he hath in the ſight of thy Countenance, to make him languiſh in our embraces, ſwallow the poiſon of this miſerable Life, and groan under the burden of our mortal afflictions? In ſhort, can I be ſo ſenſeleſs, as to remove him out of that Eternal Life, to cauſe him to become again the ſport of Death? He is paſs'd from Death to Life, is it my deſire that he ſhould return back from Life, into the mercileſs hands of Death? we ſhall go to him, but he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not come to us; ſeeing that this life is ſo ſhort, that it is ſpent and gone as a thought, we ſhall ſee one another ſhortly in the light of the Living. O Lord, how wonderful art thou in thy Works? how Magnificent in the means that thou employeſt? and how various is thy Wiſdom in all things? I ſee that what thou haſt done, is not only for thy Glory, and for the advantage of this happy Creature, a that thou haſt received into thy Reſt; but it is alſo for my hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, and the inſtruction of my neighbors; for in taking from me my moſt dearly Beloved, my Joy, my Pleaſure, and my Hopes, thou haſt put my Obedience and faith to a Tryal. As thou didſt heretofore try the Father of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, in requiring from him his only Son</hi> Iſaac, <hi>in whom thou hadſt promiſed to bleſs all the Nations of the World: I confeſs, good Lord, to the praiſe of thy Grace and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that my tryal is loſs than his, for thou didſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand</hi>

            <p>For that purpoſe it is not neceſſary that we ſhould go out of the World, but that the World ſhould be baniſhed, and driven out of us, and that we ſhould renounce all the vanities and unruly affections, ſo that we may be able to ſpeak with the Apoſtle, <hi>The world is crucified to me, and I am crucified to the world;</hi> for there be many who depart out of the World, but leave there their Hearts and moſt tender Affections; as <hi>Lot</hi>'s Wife that went out of <hi>Sodom,</hi> but left therewith her Treaſures and Delights, her moſt earneſt deſires; as the Iſraelites, who when they went out of <hi>Egppt,</hi> left behind them their curſed affections, with their pots of Fleſh and Onions.</p>
            <p>The ſame thing happens to many, who ſeparate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves without any neceſſity, from the acquaintance of Mankind, and who affect a ſtrange and auſtere kind of life; They leave the ſociety of wiſe and vertuous perſons, and the lawful uſe of the Bleſſings which Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven hath vouchſafed to them; and they deprive them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of all that deſerves our eſteem, and the means of glorifying God, and edifying our neighbors: but many times they carry with them their Corruptions, their Vices, and a legion of wicked Thoughts, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Deſires; By this means they give place to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, and expoſe themſelves to all his temptations; for that wicked Serpent delights himſelf rather in the Dens of Wild Beaſts, and in the Caves of the Earth, than
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:41646:59" rendition="simple:additions"/>in the Palaces and Dwellings of Princes and Kings. The moſt horrid and abominable Vices creep, and breed rather in the Deſarts, and places of Retreat, than in Publick, and in the great Cities that are full of Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants. <hi>Lot</hi> remain'd chaſt in the moſt execrable City, that was in the World, but when he went aſide to the foot of a Mountain, and into a Cave to dwell, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed himſelf with a monſtruous Inceſt: When Satan intended to tempt our Saviour Chriſt, he carried him into a Deſart, and to the top of a Mountain. From hence we may gather, that this ſubtil Enemy of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind hath learnt by his long experience, that the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Retreat, and the moſt ſolitary, are the fitteſt for to lay his ſnares. If our Saviour, who was wholly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent, and free from Sin, hath been able to overcome all manner of Temptations; we are not of the ſame temper, we are not furniſhed with ſuch Armor as he was, of Proof, againſt all the enflamed Darts of the Devil; for our miſerable Fleſh delights in its own deſtruction; it opens the Ears and the Heart wide, to the deceitful promiſes of <hi>Satan,</hi> and ſuffers it ſelf to be cheated, by his damnable Enchantments; It flatters us, and cauſeth us to be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ull'd aſlcep in its boſom, then, like a treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous <hi>Dalilah,</hi> it betrays us into the unmerciful hands of our great Enemy.</p>
            <p>Some cloath themſelves with Hair, and wear at their Girdle a knotted Cord, whom the Devil drags to Hell with the inviſible Chains of Luſt; Others climb up to the top of frozen Mountains, and yet their Hearts do burn with impure Flames; Some fret themſelves in a mournful ſolitarineſs, whoſe deſires and longings, are for the world, and its vanities: Others have their hands lifted up to Heaven, whoſe mind is enſlaved to the Earth, and rooted in the rotten and filthy plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of the Times; Some have a Lamp burning be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, whoſe underſtanding is wrapt in groſs dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, more palpable than that of <hi>Egypt:</hi> Others have
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:41646:60" rendition="simple:additions"/>an empty Stomach, whoſe Soul is full of abominable Paſſions. In ſhort, Some live in appearance like Angels, and yet they are poſſeſſed by legions of infernal Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits: Other ſeem to have no concernment in the World, and yet lodge the whole World in their Hearts.</p>
            <p>Under a courſe Habit, there dwells oftimes more En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy, more Vanity, and Ambition, than under the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous attire of Silk and Gold: Through a torn cloathing ſome Souls may be perceived ſwell'd with Pride and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogancy, and in the company of Beggars, are to be found many times the Deſignes of Kings, and the lof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thoughts of the greateſt Monarchs: To ſpeak plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the good things and advantages of this life, don't ſtop and wed us, of themſelves, to this World, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that Love and Affection which we bear to them; for without doubt, there be many that are more earneſt and affectionate, for the things that they want, than others that enjoy them: Some poor people have a far greater longing for Riches, than ever <hi>Solomon</hi> had in the midſt of all his great Treaſures: Some ſilly Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men that are covered with old Rags, and ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible <hi>Joanes</hi> have more Vanity and Pride in their Brains, than ever had Queen <hi>Eſther,</hi> in her Richeſt and moſt Glorious Attire. The Prophet <hi>Daniel</hi> was rais'd to an high and eminent Honour, for he was the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of the third part of the Monarchy of the Perſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and of the Medes; nevertheleſs, he was no more concerned in <hi>Babylon,</hi> than if he had had there but a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulcre, and worn the Chains of a Slave; he ſends forth as many Sighs, and pours as many Tears, as if he had been lying upon the Aſhes of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some pittiful Beggars, are more loath to quit their Rags, than the Soveraign Princes, to lay down the Enſignes of their Dignity and Honour: Such are more enſlav'd to their filth and baſeneſs, than the greateſt Monarchs to the Glory and Splendor of their Empire. Death labors as much to free a man from his Priſon, and
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:41646:60" rendition="simple:additions"/>to take him out of his Dungeon, as to drive him out of his Palace, and to tumble him from his Throne; The Poor and the Indigent, who have no other Bed to lye upon than the hard ground, doth make as much reſiſtance, as the Rich, who are ſtretched upon the ſofteſt Couches: The Galley-ſlaves are as unwilling that Death ſhould looſe them from their Chains, and take them out of their miſery, as the Kings and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are to leave their Scepters and their Crowns. I am fully perſwaded that <hi>David</hi> was more willing to go from his Command, and from his Riches, than ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny poor wretches are to depart from their Dunghils, and their meanneſs. Some perſons are tormented with the Gout, the Stone, and other grievous and ſenſible pains; they deſire nevertheleſs, more paſſionately, to live, than many that enjoy a perfect and a flouriſhing Health. Carnal and Earthly Souls, are ſo much bound to the Earth, that they feel an horrid reluctancy, and an unſpeakable diſpleaſure, when they are to depart from a Body, rotten, and falling to pieces with old Age; whereas others that are more ſpiritualiz'd, and that have taſted of the Heavenly Gift, and of the powers of the World to come, depart moſt willingly out of young and luſty Bodies, flouriſhing in their Strength and Beauty.</p>
            <p>We muſt not therefore remove out of the World our Legs and Arms, but our Affections and vain Luſts; If God beſtows upon us his Earthly Bleſſings, we are not to follow the example of that extravagant Philoſopher, who caſt into the Sea his Silver, and his precious Stones, that he might not have the trouble to keep them, and who loſt them willingly, that he might not be in any further danger of looſing them after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards; but we muſt take heed, that they cauſe not our Faith to make Shipwrack, and that we regard them not more than our Conſciences, for the Soul is a far more precious Jewel, than the Body, and Life, far
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:41646:61" rendition="simple:additions"/>more conſiderable than Cloathing. Seeing that God beſtows upon us ſo many good things, with an intent that we ſhould enjoy them; we ſhould ſhew our ſelves unthankful to his goodneſs, contrary to his wiſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, and unjuſt and cruel to our ſelves, to refuſe the means of ever uſing, and employing theſe Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings. All Gods creatures are good, and none are to be rejected, ſo that we take them with thankſgiving, for they are ſanctified by the word of God, and by Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.</p>
            <p>The Honors and Riches that we receive from our Birth, or that we obtain by lawful and juſt means, are to be rank'd amongſt the Bleſſings of God; therefore <hi>Eſther</hi> who was but a poor ſtranger, received with joy, as a favor from Heaven<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Imperial Crown that was put upon her Head, and ſhe refuſed not to be the Wife of the greateſt Monarch of that time. <hi>Joſeph</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted willingly the power and dignity, with which King <hi>Pharaoh</hi> had inveſted him; and the Prophet <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel</hi> did not only receive the honourable Commands which were beſtowed upon him by the King of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon,</hi> but he employed his Power and Credit, to raiſe alſo his Companions, to the places of Truſt, and to the Government of that Empire. God doth ſometimes give the Scepters into the hands of cruel and prophane perſons, ſuch as was <hi>Pharaoh, Ahab, Nebuchadnezar, Belſhaſar,</hi> and <hi>Herod,</hi> to teach us, that it is not the chief good of Man, and that we muſt aim at a more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Kingdom, and at more ſolid and conſtant Felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; He doth alſo place upon the Throne, Men ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his own heart, whom he cheriſheth as the Apple of his Eye; as <hi>David, Solomon, Jehoſaphat, He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zekiah,</hi> and <hi>Joſias,</hi> to teach us, that the fear of God, and the expectation of an immortal Crown, is not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtant with the Honors of this Life, nor with worldly Glory, <hi>For true Piety hath the promiſes of this life, and of that which is to come.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="115" facs="tcp:41646:61" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p>The Riches of the Earth are no more hurtful than the Honors and Dignities, unleſs it be by acciddent; they are very uſeful and advantageous to ſuch as em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy them well, and that diſpoſe of them with an Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſcretion; They are powerful helps to true Piety, and excellent means to glorify God, and to exerciſe our Mercy and Compaſſion; I may ſay that they give a Luſt to the Zeal and Charity of God's Children, Riches turn into evils, and are ill beſtowed in the hand of a Brute, and ſordid <hi>Nabal</hi> at the diſpoſition of a mercileſs and voluptuous Glutton, as the rich Man of the Goſpel, of a perfidious and treacherous <hi>Judas,</hi> of a ſilly and debauch'd Youth, as the prodigal Son; but they are the Bleſſings of Heaven, when they happen in the hand of a <hi>Joſeph,</hi> who nouriſhed therewith his Father, and all his kindred, in the hands of a <hi>David,</hi> that employed them in offerings to Almighty God in the ſight of his people, of a <hi>Solomon,</hi> who built a magnificent Temple, and of a <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> who ſpent them not in Luxury and Vanity, nor in curious Trinkets, but to buy a box full of precious Ointment, which ſhe poured on the head of the Saviour of the World. They are bleſſings indeed, when ſuch an one enjoys them, as <hi>Cornelius</hi> the Centurion, who employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them in Almes, whereof the perfume aſcended up to the Throne of the God of Mercies. In ſhort, our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who is the Eternal Wiſdom of his Father, hath uttered out of his Sacred mouth, that <hi>It is more bleſſed to give than to receive, Acts</hi> 20.</p>
            <p>I am not ignorant of the Oracle pronounced by this Great God and Saviour, <hi>That whoſoever doth not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce Father, Mother, Houſes and Lands for my ſake is not worthy of me.</hi> Mat. 10. This was ſaid to teach us, that we muſt renounce with Heart and Affection, all things in the World, and of this preſent Life, and that we muſt be always ready to abandon all, in caſe we cannot keep them without offending God, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:41646:62" rendition="simple:additions"/>a ſcandal to his Church; but without ſuch an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute neceſſity, God doth not require from us in any place of Scripture, actually to quit and leave our world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Poſſeſſions.</p>
            <p>I know alſo very well, that when a young man did enquire from our Saviour, <hi>What he was to do to inherit Eternal life;</hi> Luke 18. This wiſe Teacher return'd him this anſwer, <hi>Sell all that thou haſt and give it to the poor, and thou ſhalt have Riches in Heaven, then come and follow me. Luk</hi> 18. This was a particular Commandement made only to that man, upon a ſingular occaſion, from whence it is not poſſible that we ſhould gather any concluſion to oblige others to the ſame action; for otherwiſe this might oblige all Chriſtians in general to ſell what they have without exception, and to give it to the poor: The Commandment was given upon this occaſion, This vain glorious Phariſee did boaſt of having kept all the Commandements of God from from his youth up. To remove this good opinion of himſelf out of his mind, and to give a vent to the ſwelling of his Phariſaical Pride, our Lord puts him to a Trial, enjoyning him to ſell all his Goods, and to give them to the poor. At theſe words the poor young man went away, very ſad in a confuſion, becauſe he had much Riches, and his Heart, and greateſt affections were with his Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures. By this proceeding he diſcovered that he was far from loving God with all his Heart, and with all his Soul, and with all his Strength, becauſe that it did appear, that he did love his worldly poſſeſſions more than Chriſt and his Bleſſedneſs. You may there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore underſtand without difficulty, devout Souls, that this Commandement that was made to this young man, extends not to all in general; If it had been otherwiſe, the Holy Apoſtles who were mindful of every thing that did tend to perfection, would not have reſted ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with the loſs of their Goods, to follow Chriſt, as they declared to him themſelves, <hi>We have left all,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:41646:62" rendition="simple:additions"/>and have followed thee,</hi> Matth. 19. But they would have totally quitted all their enjoyments, and would have reſerved nothing for themſelves, which they did not; for <hi>St. John,</hi> Chriſt's beloved Diſciple, had a Dwelling Houſe, where he entertain'd the Holy Virgin, after our Saviours death, <hi>John</hi> 19, And the other Apoſtles had their Ships, their Nets and Tackling, therefore af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Chriſts Reſurrection, they returned to their Fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Trade.</p>
            <p>Our Saviour, upon this occaſion of the young mans refuſing to obey this expreſs and particular Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand <hi>of ſelling his goods, and giving them to the poor,</hi> Informs his Diſciples, <hi>That it is hard for a Rich man to enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> But he explains in another place this paſſage in ſuch a manner, that he leaves not the leaſt difficulty in it; when he ſaith, That it is hard for them who put their confidence in Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, to enter into the Kingdom of God, <hi>Mat.</hi> 19. By this we may underſtand, that he ſpeaks not of all rich Men in general, but of ſuch only who put their truſt in their Riches; therefore the Apoſtle <hi>St. Paul</hi> don't Command the rich Men to caſt away their Eſtates, and Goods, but he adviſes them not to put their confidence in them, ſo as to become more vain and prouder. In this manner he ſpeaks to <hi>Timothy, Charge them that are rich in this World, that they be not high minded, nor truſt in uncertain Riches, but in the living God, who giveth us richly all things to enjoy.</hi> 1 Tim. 6.</p>
            <p>Here are therefore the beſt directions, according to my judgement, for a true Chriſtian who deſires to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to God, to attain to the diſpoſitions neceſſary for an happy Death.</p>
            <p>Firſt, we muſt employ our moſt aſſidual and earneſt endeavours and affections, for the Eternal advantages of the Soul, and of the Life to come; we muſt thirſt impatiently for the Graces of God, and for the Gifts of his Holy Spirit, we muſt ſigh and long for the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:41646:63" rendition="simple:additions"/>Riches of the Soul, and labour with all our ſtrength to attain to the uncorruptible Crown, and the immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Glory of Heaven. Chriſt gives us this Holy and ſafe advice, <hi>Seek,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>firſt the Kingdom of God-and his Righteouſneſs, and all theſe things ſhall be added unto you,</hi> Mat. 6. And elſewhere, Labour not for the Meat which periſheth, but for that Meat which endureth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to everlaſting life, <hi>John</hi> 6.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As the good King <hi>Solomon</hi> built firſt the Lord's Houſe, and then laid the foundation of his own Palace. Thus we ought to proceed to labour firſt for the advancement of God's Kingdom, and the edificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of his Church, then we may have liberty to employ our ſelves about the affairs of this preſent life, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout our worldly concerns; but our Employment and Calling, muſt be juſt, and allowed by the Laws of God and of Man, for he that gains Riches by unlawful Arts, is but a Thief and a Robber.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Before we engage in any work, we muſt pray to God to vouchſafe his Bleſſing to it, and ſpeak to him as <hi>Moſes, Let the beauty of the Lord our God be upon us, and eſtabliſh thou the work of our hands upon us, yea the work of our hands, eſtabliſh thou it,</hi> Pſal. 90. For with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his Aſſiſtance and Bleſſing, all our labors will be in vain, and to little purpoſe. It is God that makes poor and makes rich, that lifts up, and abaſeth, 1 <hi>Jam.</hi> 2. <hi>Neither is he that planteth any thing, neither he that wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereth, but God that giveth the increaſe,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. The Royal Prophet is of the ſame judgement, when he ſaith, If the Lord buildeth not the City, their labor is but loſt that build it.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Our Labors muſt be without murmurings, and miſtruſting God's Providence, we muſt baniſh out of our minds, all idle thoughts, and groundleſs expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that diſturb us, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 107. We muſt pluck out of our hearts all the cares and diſpleaſures that trouble us. We muſt imprint in our minds that excellent Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:41646:63" rendition="simple:additions"/>of <hi>David, Caſt thy burden upon the Lord, and he ſhall ſuſtain thee,</hi> Pſal. 5. and that of <hi>St. Peter, Caſt all your care upon him, for he careth for you,</hi> 1 Pet. 5. We muſt remember our Saviours charge, Take heed to your ſelves, leaſt at any time your hearts be overcharged with ſurfeiting and drunkenneſs, and cares of this life, <hi>Luk</hi> 21.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Above all things we muſt beware of the ſlaviſh vice of Covetouſneſs, that denies God's good Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and his fatherly Care; To that purpoſe <hi>St. Paul</hi> exhorts us in expreſs words, <hi>Let your converſation be without covetouſneſs, and be content with ſuch things as ye have, for he hath ſaid I will never leave thee nor forſake thee,</hi> Heb. 13. That he might beget in us an averſion of this infamous Vice, <hi>St. Paul</hi> tels us, <hi>They that will be rich, fall into temptation and a ſnare, and into many fooliſh and hurtful Luſts, which drown Men in deſtruction and perdition;</hi> 1 Tim. 6. He adds next, <hi>For the love of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney is the root of all evil, which, which ſome coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themſelves through with many ſorrows.</hi> Coloſ, 3. The ſame Apoſtle declares, That Covetouſneſs is Idolatry, and that it ſhall never inherit the kingdom of God, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. Therefore we ought to follow the wiſe King's advice, <hi>Labour not to be rich, but forbear from any ſuch deſigne,</hi> Prov. 25.</p>
            <p n="6">6. If God is pleaſed to afflict us with poverty, and to caſt us down in the duſt of a mean Eſtate, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding our continual labors in a lawful Calling; Let us endeavour to poſſeſs our Souls with patience; look upon Chriſt our Saviour, who for our ſakes became poor, although he was rich, that we might be enrich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with his poverty; Let us beſeech him to grant us the bleſſed diſpoſition of <hi>St. Paul,</hi> that we may be able to ſpeak as he did, <hi>I have learn'd to be content in whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever eſtate I am, I know both how to be abaſed, and I know how to abound every where, and in all things; I am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed, both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to ſuffer need, I can do all things through Chriſt, which
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:41646:64" rendition="simple:additions"/>ſtrengtheneth me. Phil.</hi> 4. Remember, Chriſtian Souls, to ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle your Treaſure in Heaven, where neither the Moth, nor Ruſt can corrupt, and where Thieves cannot break through and ſteal; Labor to be rich in Faith, and in good Works, that you may inherit the Kingdom that God hath promiſed to them that love him.</p>
            <p n="7">7. But if it hath pleaſed God to bleſs thy labors, and if his powerful and liberal hand hath raiſed thee up to great Honor, ſo that thou enjoyeſt Riches in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance, thou muſt remember to poſſeſs them in ſuch a manner, that they may not enſlave thee: and according to <hi>St. Paul's</hi> advice, thou muſt remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber to enjoy them, as if thou enjoyeſt them not, and that the faſhion of this World paſſeth away; we muſt not truſt upon them, nor pride in them; we ought to glory in ſomething elſe, as God himſelf ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts us, Let not the wiſe man boaſt of his wiſdom, nor the ſtrong of his ſtrength, Let not the rich man glory in his Riches, but he that glories, let him glory in that he hath underſtanding, and knows me, <hi>Jer.</hi> 9.</p>
            <p n="8">8. We muſt not only take off our hearts and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from the world and its vanities, trample upon them and eſteem them like Dung, in compariſon of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable Treaſures of Heaven; but we muſt alſo be ready to leave them at every moment, as ſo many tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fles, vain, and periſhable things; as we are to poſſeſs them without diſpleaſure and fear, ſo we muſt part with them without grief and murmuring. When we ſhould looſe in a day all that God hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed upon us in the world, it becomes us to ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en our ſelves with an Holy confidence, and reſolution, ſaying with <hi>Job, The Lord gave, and the Lord hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away, bleſſed be the name of the Lord, Job</hi> 1.</p>
            <p n="9">9. If we happen to part with our Goods, Honors, and Dignities in the ſervice of God, and for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Chriſts Goſpel; in ſuch a caſe, we ought to endure the loſs with a Chriſtian patience, and an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:41646:64" rendition="simple:additions"/>joy, becauſe that ſuch a loſs for a juſt cauſe, will prove at laſt to our advantage and glory: This was the practice of the faithful Hebrews, of whom <hi>St. Paul</hi> ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders this teſtimony <hi>You have received with joy the ſpoiling of your Goods, knowing that you have in Heaven a better and a more laſting inheritance,</hi> Heb. 10. Chriſtian Souls repreſent unto your ſelves the example of the Prophet <hi>Moſes,</hi> who <hi>eſteem'd the reproach of Chriſt greater riches, than the Treaſures of Egypt, for he had a reſpect unto the recompenſe of the reward,</hi> Heb. 11.</p>
            <p n="10">10. Whilſt we enjoy our Goods, we muſt take care of the poor, and be bountiful in Alms, and to ſpeak in <hi>St. Paul's</hi> language, Whilſt we have any time, let us do good, eſpecially to the houſhold of faith, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. Whoever hath compaſſion of the poor, makes God his debter, he will aſſuredly return him his good Deed, <hi>Prov.</hi> 19. Our Saviour promiſeth to recompenſe a Cup of cold water, that ſhall be given to the meaneſt of ſuch as believe in his name, <hi>Matt.</hi> 10. Alms is a Seed that is caſt upon Earth, but its Flowers and moſt excellent Fruits are to be gather'd in Heaven, He that ſows li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berally ſhall reap liberally: It is not therefore as that other Seed, mentioned <hi>Pſal.</hi> 126. That they that ſow in Tears, ſhall reap with Songs of Triumph, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. For whoſoever beſtows his Alms ſparingly, and unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly, he ſhall be Treated in the ſame manner as him that refuſeth to part with it; therefore <hi>St. Paul</hi> declares, <hi>When I ſhould give all my Goods to nouriſh the poor, if I have no Charity I am nothing,</hi> 2 Cor. 13. God loves a chearful Giver, and delights in ſuch Sacrifices, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. Remember therefore Chriſtians, that God ſhall judge you at the laſt day, not by your Learning, Knowledge, Riches, or Dignities and Honors of this life, but by your Alms, Deeds, and acts of Charity and Hoſpitality, and by the diſtributing of your Goods, to the neceſſities of the Saints. Make to your ſelves friends of the Mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon of unrighteouſneſs, that when you fail they may
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:41646:65" rendition="simple:additions"/>receive you into the everlaſting Habitations, <hi>Matt.</hi> 25. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. <hi>Luke</hi> 16. That upon your Tomb, one may juſtly engrave. <hi>He hath ſcattered, he hath given to the poor his Righteouſneſs,</hi> that is, his Charity and Alms-deeds <hi>remain for ever.</hi> Pſal. 112.</p>
            <p n="11">11. Finally, we muſt not only take off our Heart and Affections, from the Riches, Honors, and Vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of this World, but we muſt alſo deny our ſelves, tame and overcome our paſſions, and crucify our Fleſh with its Luſts. Therefore our great God and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, calls upon us from Heaven. <hi>He that will follow me, let him deny himſelf, take up his Croſs daily and come after me,</hi> Matt. 10.</p>
            <p>That we may be able to imprint this good Leſſon in our minds, we ſhould ſeriouſly conſider in the firſt place, that we are but ſtrangers and pilgrims in this world, and that we have no laſting City, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. The Houſes that God grants to us, are no perpetual Dwellings, but only Inns for our preſent accommodation: This was the frequent conſideration of the great Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs, <hi>Abraham, Iſaack,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> who ſaw the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes afar off, believed and embraced them; for <hi>St. Paul</hi> informs us, that they did ingeniouſly profeſs, that they were no better than ſtrangers and pilgrims upon earth, and that their intention was to march forwards to their Celeſtial Countrey. This was <hi>Jacobs</hi> language when he appeared before <hi>Pharaoh; The days of my pilgrimage have been ſhort and evil, they have not attain'd to the years of the life of my Fathers, and of the time of their pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage,</hi> Heb. 12. Gen. 47. And not only the antient Patriarchs, who never had any other poſſeſſions in the world, than a Tomb, or ſome ſmall piece of ground, have acknowledg'd themſelves to be ſtrangers and pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grims, but Princes and Kings alſo whom God hath ſanctified by his Holy Spirit, have freely confeſs'd the ſame; for <hi>David</hi> declares not in the time of his baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, nor of his flight, nor in his calamities and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:41646:65" rendition="simple:additions"/>but in his moſt flouriſhing Eſtate, and in the midſt of his Triumphs, Glory, Plenty, and Proſperity, he declares unto God, <hi>I am a ſtranger and a forreigner with thee, as all my Fathers were,</hi> Pſal. 39. &amp; 119. And when he ſpeaks, not only of himſelf, but alſo of the reſt of God's Children that are upon Earth, he makes no diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty to confeſs, <hi>We are ſtrangers and forreigners with thee, as all our Fathers were, and our days are as a ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow upon Earth that have no ſtop,</hi> 1 Chron. 29. Rich and Poor, Maſters and Servants, Princes and Subjects, all of us in general, we may, with reaſon, ſay to the Men of this World, as <hi>Abraham</hi> to the Children of <hi>Heth, I am a ſtranger and a forreigner in the midſt of you.</hi> Now he that travels in a ſtrange Countrey, may ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſome Flowers in his paſſage, or take with him a few Ears of Corn, but if he be wiſe, he will never tarry to build a Palace. If he be well Treated in his Inn, he muſt not caſt away the good chear, but if his Entertainment be bad, he muſt endure with patience, the inconveniencies, and contemn all the diſorders that happen during his abode; if the way be deep, full of Mud, Bryars and Thorns, he muſt get out of them aſſoon as he can; and if it be good and pleaſant, he muſt not ſtop in it, nor buſy himſelf with needleſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries. Every one that is a Traveller dreams of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but how to advance in his journey, and go for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward: Likewiſe, we being accuſtomed to Plenty, and Want, to Riches and Poverty, to Honor and Diſhonor; we ought to leave the things that are behind, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed forward to ſuch as are before, that we may attain to the end and reward of our Heavenly Calling. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Conſider, not only, I beſeech you, that we are ſtrangers and forrainers in the world, but that we are not to inhabit always in this forrain Countrey, but that our paſſage will be but of few days, <hi>Revel.</hi> 7. We need but little to nouriſh and entertain us in this ſhort race; at the end of it we ſhall neither hunger nor thirſt,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:41646:66" rendition="simple:additions"/>and the Sun ſhall burn us no more. As it happen'd with <hi>Jacob</hi> and his Family, when they went into <hi>Egypt,</hi> they had no other Corn nor Food, but what was need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and neceſſary for them in the way; becauſe they were certain to meet with plenty of all manner of good things in <hi>Joſeph's</hi> Houſe: Likewiſe we need not make any great proviſion for our ſelves in this life becauſe we are marching apace towards our Saviour Chriſt, our elder Brother, unto whom God hath given all pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in Heaven and in Earth <hi>Matt.</hi> 28. We are march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into a Countrey that abounds with all manner of true Riches, Excellency, Glory, and Happineſs.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Conſider, that we are not only ſtrangers, but Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers to fight under the banners of Chriſt our Captain, who judges and fights juſtly, <hi>Revel.</hi> 19. <hi>Job</hi> acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges <hi>That there is a warfare appointed to all Mortals up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Earth;</hi> Job 7. But I may ſay that this War is chiefly for ſuch as aim at the glorious immutability. For God calls them to endure grievous and violent encounters; Therefore <hi>St. Paul</hi> exhorts his beloved Diſciple <hi>Timothy</hi> to behave himſelf as a good Soldier in this juſt War, and to fight the good fight of faith, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. Now he that goes to War, muſt not incumber himſelf with the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs and enjoyments of this life.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Moreover, conſider, that we are like to Soldiers that are engag'd in an Enemies Countrey, not with a deſign to conquer, and eſtabliſh our Selves, but only to obtain a free paſſage, having only an intent to paſs thorough into our own Native Countrey; We don't deſire to get into our hands, the Inheritances and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions of the Worldlings, nor to rob them of their Crowns and Scepters; We have no other requeſt to make to them, but that which the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> made to the Inhabitants of <hi>Edom,</hi> when they were go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the promiſed Land, <hi>Numb.</hi> 20. We deſire leave to paſs peaceably, and go along by the Kings high way, to take poſſeſſion of the Inheritance which God hath
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:41646:66" rendition="simple:additions"/>prepared for us from the beginning of the World; We would not ſo much as taſte a bit of Bread without paying for it, nor drink a cup of water without leave.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Conſider that this Life is a Race, and the World the place to run in; now ſuch as are in a Race, muſt take heed that the Thorns do not catch hold of them in their Courſe, nor that their Feet ſink into the Mire or the Clay; and that they may run ſwifter, they muſt caſt off all burdens and incumbrances. If therefore we will run in this Race in ſuch a manner, as that we may obtain the Prize, we muſt ſee that the Thorns and Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ars of the World do not take hold of us, and that we ſink not into the mire of the dirty Pleaſures of this life; we muſt caſt away all the burdens that overcharge us, and eſpecially the burden of ſin, which is ſo grievous, that Nature it ſelf gr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ns under it. It is the deſign of St. <hi>Paul's</hi> exhortation, <hi>Seeing we are compaſſed about with ſo great a cloud of witneſſes; Let us lay aſide every weight, and the ſin which doth ſo eaſily beſet us, and let us run with patience the Race that is ſet before us, looking un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Jeſus the Author and finiſher of our faith, who, for the joy that was ſet before him, endured the Croſs,</hi> Rom. 8. Heb. 12.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Conſider, that our life is a continual wreſtling; for we muſt wreſtle, not only againſt Fleſh and Blood, but alſo againſt Principalities and Powers, againſt the Lords of the World, and the Rulers of the darkneſs of this age, againſt ſpiritual wickedneſs in high places, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. Now he that intends to wreſtle well, muſt diet himſelf accordingly. If therefore for a corruptible Crown, Men tame their Bodies, render them ſupple and pliant, and abſtain from Delights and Pleaſures; how much more reaſon have we to do the like for an uncorruptible and a Glorious Crown?</p>
            <p n="7">7. Conſider, that God will have us to be conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the image of his Son, and that we ſhould fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:41646:67" rendition="simple:additions"/>his footſteps; Now this good Saviour repreſents to us his own condition, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. <hi>The Foxes have holes, and the Birds of the air have Neſts, but the Son of man hath not whereon to lay his head,</hi> Luke 9. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he made this confeſſion before <hi>Pontius Pilate, My Kingdom is not of this World,</hi> John 8. and for that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon he reproves the groſs and carnal imaginations of the two Diſciples, as they were going to <hi>Emaus;</hi> O fools, and ſlow of heart, to believe all that the Prophets have ſpoken, <hi>Luke</hi> 24. ought not Chriſt to have ſuffered theſe things and to enter into his Glory; according to his bleſſed example, we muſt have little part and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment in the World, and enter by many afflictions into the kingdom of God, <hi>Acts</hi> 24.</p>
            <p n="8">8. I judge, that it is alſo neceſſary that we ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent at every moment unto our ſelves, that to ſpeak exactly, we can have but the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> and not the right en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of Gods Creatures; We are intruſted with his favors, as the Stewards of his Bleſſings and Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es. At every moment he may call us to an account, and require from us a reaſon of our behaviour, and take from us our enjoyments: we ſhould therefore look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our Houſes and Poſſeſſions, as upon things that are let unto us: for as we are not diſpleas'd to reſtore what we had borrowed, and what we enjoy, as long as it pleaſeth the lawful owner to lend it; thus we ſhall freely leave this preſent life, and all our worldly poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions, in caſe we can but perſwade our ſelves, that all belongs to God, and that he hath lent them but for a moment.</p>
            <p n="9">9. Moreover, it is neceſſary for us, to conſider the fruitleſs labors and pains that we are at, when we pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe the Riches of the Earth, and aſcend up to the Dignities and Honors; for as the Husbandman, when he hath ſpent himſelf in manuring his Field, and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd it with his ſweat, is many times deceived of all fair hopes, and his expectation fruſtrated. Thus it
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:41646:67" rendition="simple:additions"/>commonly happens to the covetous and ambitious; they toil and labour in vain; the Goods which they think to grasp, ſlides away between their fingers as Water, or as Wax, that melts at the firſt approach of the Fire, and all the Honors which they expect to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy and embrace, are as a ſhadow that ſoon vaniſhes, or as a ſmoak that flies up out of their reach: when they have well ſown theſe vanities, they rerp nothing but grief and diſpleaſure.</p>
            <p n="10">10. Take notice of the little contentment and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, that there is to be found in the moſt entire and perfect enjoyment of the advantages of this World. They are like a Drink that leaves us ſtill a Thirſt, and like an empty Meat that cannot ſatiate our Longing; Like the Waters of the Weli of <hi>Sychar,</hi> whereof our Saviour ſaid to the Woman of <hi>Samaria, He that drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of this Water ſhall thirſt again,</hi> Joh. 4. It happens to the Worldlings, as to him who ſleeps hungry, and dreams that he is eating, when he wakes his ſtomach is empty, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 29. or like to another that thinks in his ſleep that he drinks, but when his eyes are open, he finds himſelf weary, and his Appetite unſatisfied; for he that hungers for Money is never contented with the enjoyment of it, and he that thirſts for vain Glory, can never be pleas'd with all the great Honors and Grandeur of the World, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 5. Inſtead of ſatiating his longing Appetite, theſe things ſerve but to increaſe and augment it. The whole World was not large enough to ſatisfy the fooliſh ambition of <hi>Alexander;</hi> for it is ſaid, that he wept when a Philoſopher told him, that there were yet many Worlds to conquer; This Man, to whom ſix foot of Earth, was ſufficient, had a mind to command over a thouſand Worlds, if there had been ſo many in being.</p>
            <p n="11">11. Conſider, that all the Treaſuries and Riches of the <hi>Indies,</hi> and the pomp and grandeur of the World, are not able to bring Peace to the Soul, nor quiet to
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:41646:68" rendition="simple:additions"/>the troubled Conſciences; when a poor man hath got together a little Silver and Gold, or when a mean per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is rais'd to the higheſt Offices, and greateſt Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, his miſery continues ſtill, although it changes its appearance, oft-times it is ſo much the more unſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, in that it puts on a falſe luſter, and a deceitful Gloſs, in that ſuch are conſtrain'd to live always mask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to ſuppreſs the pangs, the grief, the ſighs and groans, that often interrupt their prophane ſmiles, and carnal delights and paſtimes.</p>
            <p>Therefore our Saviour compares Riches to Thorns, for they prick and gaul, not only the Hands but the Heart and Bowels of ſuch as embrace them with af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection; it may be ſaid alſo that they are like Lions and Bears, for they are not to be caught without much difficulty, and they are as uneaſy to be kept, becauſe we muſt take heed, that we be not bit with their vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous and deadly Teeth. If you had but tried the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible diſpleaſures, the ſenſible griefs, and the ſecret fears, with the tormenting cares that attend upon the moſt glorious Scrpters, and the richeſt Crowns; you would never judge the ſaying of that Prince unreaſonable, who exclaimed againſt his Royalty in this manner, <hi>O Crown, if any did but know thy weight, he would never lift thee up from the ground.</hi> The moſt part of the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, and the ſatisfactions of this life, depend much upon mans imagination, and al this grandeur and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Glory, is nothing but wind. The Royal Prophet teacheth us this Truth with much elegancy, when he ſaith, <hi>That every man at his beſt ſtate, is altogether vanity; ſurely every man walketh in a vain ſhew, ſurely they are diſquieted in vain,</hi> Pſal. 39. <hi>Solomon,</hi> the moſt Learned of all Kings, the Richeſt, and moſt Magnificent Prince of his time, had refus'd nothing to his Eyes, to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify his Luſt, he had taſted of all the delights and paſtimes that can be imagined, but at laſt he found ſo little ſatisfaction, and ſolid content, that he was forc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:41646:68"/>to acknowledge <hi>That all things under the Sun are but vanity and vexation of Spirit,</hi> Ecc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="12">12. Chiefly, we are to conſider, that if our Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments have been wrongfully gotten, as <hi>Balaams</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, <hi>Achans</hi> wedge of Gold, and Scarlet Cloak, <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hazis</hi> changes of Raiment, <hi>Ahabs</hi> and <hi>Jezabels</hi> Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard, <hi>Judas</hi> his Thirty pieces, <hi>Numb.</hi> 22. <hi>Joſh.</hi> 7. they can bring no real content, nor peace to the Soul, but they rather fill us with horrors of Conſcience, and with a fearful deſpair; 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 5. 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 21. If the voluptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Worldling that hath enriched himſelf by Rapine, Uſury, and Extorſion, did wring with his hands his ſumptuous Garments, where his pomp and pride ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, he ſhould viſibly ſqueeze out the Tears of the afflicted and poor People, <hi>Matt.</hi> 27. If he did but reliſh the right taſt of the Liquors, that he drinks out of his Cups of Jasper and Chryſtal, he ſhould find, inſtead of Wine and Lemonade, the ſweat and blood of many wretches, and if he did but ſeriouſly look into the Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and Golden Veſſels that are put upon his Table, he ſhould perceive the Marrow and the Bones of ſuch as he hath devour'd. Whoſoever becomes fat with the ſubſtance of the Widow and the Fatherleſs, ſhall never open his Coffers, but he may ſpy there the Image of the Devil, and the Helliſh Furies; he may hear the crys and groans of ſuch, whom he hath deſtroyed by his unjuſtice and cruelties; If ſuch eſcape unpuniſhed here upon Earth, they ſhall ſurely feel the ſeverity of God's vengeance hereafter. If there be no Sword to ſtrike them, nor Fire to conſume them, nor Leproſie to gnaw them, nor Dogs to tear them, nor Halter to hang them; they have a guilty Conſcience that will perform more than this, for it will be their witneſs to accuſe them, their judge to condemn them, their Rack, their Wheel, and Executioner to torture them; The time will come when the Worm that never dies, and the Fire that ſhall never be quencht, ſhall torment and burn them.</p>

            <p n="13">13. Conſider, that it is poſſible to be very indigent in the midſt of a great plenty; The Poets have had a deſigne to repreſent this by the fiction of a Man thirſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a River, whereof the Waters did reach up to his chin. The covetous Miſer is like to this miſerable wretch, He may be alſo compar'd to the Figtree of the Goſpel, curſed by our Saviour Chriſt for it brought forth no fruit for others, and it withered for want of nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: Therefore a pleaſant poverty is better worth than riches with diſcontent; Nature is content with a little, Piety with leſs, but covetouſneſs hath no mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; The Heathens have very well acknowledged, that he was the richeſt who was moſt content, for the more things you deſire, the more are wanting to you. It matters not much, if the Cup which is preſented to you, be of Gold or of Earth, ſo that there be liquor enough to quench your thirſt; I would rather drink of a little clear ſtream of Water, than out of a great Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver all muddy and troubled. A little quantity of ground is ſufficient to nouriſh a Man in his life, but leſs is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to cover him when he is dead; A little Money ſatisfies to ſubſiſt honeſtly in the fear of God, but leſs is required to dye happily, in the favour and love of our good Saviour. Kings, and the greateſt Monarchs have but one body to nouriſh and to cloath, as well as the meaneſt of their Subjects; They who enjoy leaſt in the World, do uſe, or rather abuſe the moſt of any, the things that they poſſeſs; Inſtead of envying the World<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings opulency, let us meditate upon <hi>St. Paul's</hi> excellent ſaying, <hi>Having food and raiment, let us be therewith con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,</hi> 1 Tim. 6. and let us imprint into our minds that other Sentence, <hi>Piety with contentment is great gains,</hi> 1 Tim. 1.</p>
            <p n="14">14. Chriſtian Souls, caſt your eyes upon all the things of the World that are moſt eſteem'd, and you ſhall find that their poſſeſſion is but uncertain, and of a ſhort continuance, for Riches have wings to fly to
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:41646:69" rendition="simple:additions"/>Heaven as an Eagle; All Fleſh is like Graſs, and the Glory of Man as the Flower of the Field, the World paſſeth away with all its Luſts, <hi>Prov.</hi> 23. There needs but the pillaging of a Town, the breaking of a Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant, or an unſucceſsful and contrary ſuit in Law, to render thee poor, and bring thee to want; A little ſparkle of fire, is able to reduce all thy Riches into Aſhes, and to bring thee to extream poverty: The leaſt ill look can cover thy face with ſhame and confuſion, and caſt thee down from the higheſt humane Glory, into the deepeſt Abyſſe of Diſgrace and Ignominy. The wiſe Man informs us, that <hi>He who truſts in his Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es ſhall fall.</hi> We may ſay ſo of ſuch as relye too much upon great mens favor, for it is like a broken Reed that pierceth the hands of ſuch as lean upon it. There is nothing here below ſo conſtant as unconſtancy; if the Earth did not often change its face and appearance, it would not be Earth as it is, and if the world were not unconſtant, it would ceaſe to be World; therefore it is no wonder if the Heathens, who underſtood not God's wiſe Providence, that governs the natural Beings, and draws Light out of Darkneſs, have repreſented Fortune blind, mounting ſometimes on a Wheel, and in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant tumbling down again. How many perſons do we meet with reduc'd on a ſuddain to beggery, who a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle before did flouriſh in all manner of Plenty? How many are caſt down into the duſt, and become the ſcorn of the World, who were once rais'd to the higheſt Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, and the greateſt Honors? How many fall into the contempt and deriſion of the Vulgar, whoſe praiſes were once exalted up to Heaven? In a word, how many do we ſee before our Eyes dragg'd along the ſtreets, ſhut up in cloſe priſons, brought upon the Scaffolds and Gallows, who were once the Glory of the World, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired of all men, and the ſcourge of honeſt Men? When we run over, and conſider the ſtrange, unexpected, and ſuddain changes that we have ſeen in our days, they
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:41646:70" rendition="simple:additions"/>ſeem to us as Dreams. <hi>St. Paul</hi> repreſents this great unconſtancy of the World, to take off our Hearts and Affections from it. <hi>The time,</hi> ſaith be, <hi>is ſhort, it remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that both they that have Wives be as though they had none, and they that weep as though they wept not, and they that rejoyce, as though they rejoyced not, and they that buy, as though they poſſeſſed not, and they that uſe this world, as not abuſing it, for the faſhion of this world paſſeth away,</hi> 1 Cor. 7.

In ſhort, we muſt not only quit and abandon all our Honors, Dignities, Treaſures and Riches, but we muſt alſo quit this Body, this Fleſh and Bones, cover'd with this beautiful Skin. O Man! remember that thou art but duſt, and that thou ſhalt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to Duſt.</p>

What was the cauſe of the Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites murmuring ſo often, and deſiring to return into <hi>Egypt?</hi> was it not as we have already taken notice, becauſe their Hearts and Affections were ſetled and fixed in that curſed Land, from whence God had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd them, by ſo many miracles; and wherefore did <hi>Demas</hi> leave <hi>St. Paul</hi> and Chriſt's Goſpel; It was becauſe <hi>he loved too much this preſent World;</hi> In ſhort, our own experience confirms to us the ſaying of our Saviour, <hi>No man can ſerve two Maſters, for he will hate the one and love the other, or he will cleave to the one, and deſpiſe the other, you cannot ſerve God and Mammon.</hi>

            <p n="23">23. To this purpoſe, profane Hiſtory tells us of a remarkable paſſage of <hi>Cyneas,</hi> a great Miniſter of State, to <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> King of <hi>Epirus,</hi> That when he ſaw his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter ſo buſy in raiſing of an Army, to march againſt the <hi>Romans,</hi> he began to argue with him in this manner; Sir, If it pleaſe God, to grant you the victory over the <hi>Romans,</hi> how will you employ your ſelf next? The King anſwered, We will then endeavour to conquer
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:41646:72" rendition="simple:additions"/>the reſt of <hi>Italy,</hi> and when we ſhall have <hi>Italy</hi> in our poſſeſſion replyed <hi>Cyneas,</hi> what ſhall we do afterwards? we will go againſt <hi>Sicily,</hi> ſaith the King; the diſcreet <hi>Cyneas</hi> continued to demand, and when we have all <hi>Sicily,</hi> what ſhall we do? <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> anſwered him, we wil paſs into <hi>Africa,</hi> and take <hi>Carthage</hi> and after that we may recover <hi>Macedonia,</hi> and command all <hi>Greece</hi> without controul; But Sir, replyed <hi>Cyneas,</hi> when we ſhall have got all into our poſſeſſion, what ſhall we do then? The King anſwer'd him with a ſmiling coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance; My friend, we will then repoſe our ſelves. and take our fill of Delights and Pleaſures: then <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neas</hi> began to tell the King. What hinders us now, Sir, from taking our Reſt and Delights? for we have all that in our hands, that we are going to ſeek ſo far, with ſo much Bloodſhed and Danger. We may apply this to our ſelves, we have moſt of us intricate and hidden de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes, which cannot be accompliſh'd in the age of one Man. We are afraid to dye, as if Death had already caught us by the throat and yet we have ſo many deſires to fulfil, as if we were all immortal; we build and adorn our ſumptuous Dwellings, as if we were never to leave the World; And we are always gathering ſo much, as if we had the charge of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding for a Royal Army; Let us therefore in this caſe imitate this wiſe Miniſter of State; Let us ask our ſelves for what purpoſe are theſe vaſt deſignes? what end do we propoſe to our ſelves of all our labors and care? what do we aim at when we run ſo many dangers, and endure ſo many inconveniencies? our Souls will anſwer us, without doubt, that it is with an intention, at laſt, to reſt our ſelves in peace, to live at eaſe, and enjoy the fruits of our labors; Let us en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy that happineſs and that ſatisfaction at preſent; Let us not ſtay to reſt our ſelves, until the time when Death ſhall ſtretch us in our Graves; Let us be ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the goods that God hath already beſtowed

            <p n="24">24. If we deſire to imprint in our minds the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of the World, and of its Vanities, we muſt often meditate with ſerious attention, upon the excellency of our Nature, ſanctified by Grace, upon the worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of our ſpiritual calling, and upon the Riches and Glory of that eternal Happineſs, which God hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for us in Heaven. It is impoſſible to look upon theſe things as we ought, but we muſt conclude with the Apoſtle, that the World with all its Pleaſures and Treaſures, is not worthy of us. The Woman that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to <hi>St. John</hi> in a viſion, was cloathed with the Sun, having the Moon under her feet, and a Crown of twelve Stars upon her Head; This is a lively Image of Chriſts Church in general, and of every faithful Soul in particular, for when we are cloathed and adorned with Jeſus Chriſt the Son of Righteouſneſs, we ought to trample upon all the pomp and magnificence of the World, and laugh at the revolutions of the Ages, at the Vanities and unconſtancy of the Earth; we muſt ſeek our greateſt Glory, and our moſt raviſhing De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights in the Doctrine of the twelve Apoſtles, who are as ſo many Stars ſhining in the firmament of the Church; Let the World alter its face, as often as the deceitful <hi>Laban,</hi> we ought to be as the Rayes of the Sun, always like our ſelves, for our Glory is not as that of the World, and of the Princes of this age, that is reduc'd to nothing; it is not ſetled upon a vain and failing foundation, but upon the living and true God, who is the ſame yeſterday and to day, and who ſhall be the ſame for all Eternity, <hi>Heb.</hi> 14.

He hath adorned them with immortality, that they might contemn all things that are not immortal as themſelves, all decaying and periſhing enjoyments; In ſhort, ſeeing God hath prepared for us his Heaven, his Paradiſe, his Glory, his Treaſures, and the Rivers of Eternal Delights; how can we yet ſtop our deſires, and be content with this duſt of the Earth, where Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents crawl.</p>

Thus ought we to fit our ſelves to depart out of the World, by leaving our Parents, Friends, and Eſtates that we now enjoy; and if our Fleſh enquires of us, what we kept for our ſelves, let us confidently anſwer, That we have kept our HOPE. I may aſſure you Chriſtian Souls, that this your anſwer ſhall be more rational and better grounded, than that of <hi>Alexander</hi> to his Favo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite, for this Prince did leave his Patrimony and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom without any need, but whether we will or no, we muſt leave the World. <hi>Alexander</hi> did quit his certain Goods for a doubtful Hope, but we abandon periſhing enjoyments for an Hope more ſecure and ſetled, than Heaven and Earth. <hi>Alexanders</hi> expectation was but of a temporal Kingdom; and of a ſhort and vaniſhing Glory, but our expectation is of an uncorruptible Crown,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:41646:74" rendition="simple:additions"/>and eternal Triumphs; Death hath ſeized upon <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> in the flower of his Age, put a period to all his Victories, and conſum'd all his Trophies; but we are in hopes of conquering Death it ſelf, and this hope will not deceive us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.

                  <hi>O Infinite Lord of Heaven and Earth, who diſpoſſeſt of good and evil, by thy Divine Providence, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable Wiſdom, thou haſt not ſuffer'd us to have here a laſting City, that we might ſeek for that which is to come; Thou doſt diſcover before our eyes the vanity and unconſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of all things under the Sun, that we might labor to attain to ſolid and everlaſting advantages; Thou haſt pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced and reſerved in Heaven, an inexhauſtible Treaſure of Riches uncorruptible, Crowns of Glory, and Eternal Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs, that thither we might tranſport our Heart and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections. The ſource of Heavenly pleaſures is with thee, that we might always be athirſt for the ſtrong and living God; and that we might deſire, with an Holy earneſtneſs, to look upon thy beautiful and glorious Face. Moſt Glorious Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, ſeeing thou haſt beſtowed upon me an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>mmortal Soul, ſuffer me not to be ſo wretched, as to content my ſelf with theſe mortal vanities; and ſeeing thou haſt made it of a Spiritual and Heavenly nature, ſuffer me not to be ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy, as to wallow in this miſerable duſt of the Earth, or to caſt my ſelf into the puddle and dirt of carnal Luſts. Give me Grace to renounce the World, and all the Vanities that the World adores. Give me Grace to poſſeſs all theſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caying and periſhing things, as not poſſeſſing them; that I may tramble upon all the pomp and glory of the Age; that I may conſider that the Gold, the Silver, the precious Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els, whereof the apparent beauty deceives the carnal eyes of Men, is nothing elſe but hardened Earth, that will crum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble away, and diſſolve into Duſt; that I may remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that after my deceaſe, all theſe things will profit me no more than that vile Earth, and the Stones that ſhall cover my dead Corps, or the Wood or Lead which ſhall be given to it for a Coffin. Give me grace to deſpiſe all the
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:41646:77" rendition="simple:additions"/>Honors and Dignities, after which the Men of the World run ſo impatiently, for they are but like a ſhadow that paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth away, and like the ſmoak that aſcendeth up put of our reach. Pluck out of my heart the cares of this life, and all ſolicitouſneſs for the Earth, that Death may never ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize me unawares, and that there may be nothing to ſtop or hinder from going to thee, when thou ſhalt be pleaſed to call me: that my ſoul being totally diſengag'd, and freed from all theſe Bryars and Thorns, I may be always ready at every moment, to be offered unto thee as a living and a burnt Sacrifice. The Children of Iſrael did fix and raiſe their Camp at thy Command; Give me alſo Grace to be as ready prepar'd to live and dye, to remain in this Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, and to depart out of it, when thou ſhalt ſend thine Orders: and as this people did paſs over the River</hi> Jordan, <hi>with a wonderful joy, to take poſſeſſion of the promiſed Land; O that I might alſo leave this miſerable Wilderneſs with tranſports of joy, to enter into the Celeſtial Canaan, where the Milk and Hony of Divine Pleaſures, and of Eternal Comforts flow, as in their natural Channel. O God, who art my portion, and mine inheritance, caſt me not away with the men of the World, whoſe portion is in this life. Thou doſt fill their paunch with thy good things, they are full, and leave ſufficient for their Babes; but for me, all my comfort is, that I ſhall behold thy face in Righteouſneſs, and ſhall be ſanctified when I awake with thy likeneſs,</hi> Amen.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>The Fifth Remedy againſt the fears of Death, is, to renounce Vice, and to apply our ſelves to the practice of Piety and Sanctification.</hi>
               </p>
            </argument>
            <p>GOd is ſo wonderful in all his Works, and he go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns all his Creatures in ſuch a manner, that his very Enemies are conſtrain'd to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge this Truth; You have an excellent example in <hi>Balaam,</hi> who beholding the Tents of the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> breaks out into this paſſionate wiſh, <hi>Let me dye the death of the Righteous, and let my laſt end be like his,</hi> Numb. 25. He was a wicked Varlot that loved the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of iniquity, nevertheleſs he perceived by that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetical Light, with which his Soul was enlightened, how ſweet and comfortable Death was to ſuch as ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict themſelves, in this life, to the ſervice and fear of Almighty God, and how different it is from the death of the profane Worldlings, who give themſelves over to their Luſts and Delight, in the unlawful pleaſures of the Fleſh: for as the Drunkards ſleep with a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb'd and unquiet fancy; likewiſe ſuch as are drunken and full with the baſe and rotten pleaſures of this life, if they be not hardened by Atheiſme, do commonly depart out of the World, with ſtrange frights, and horrid gripings of Conſcience, that cannot be expreſs'd. It is otherwiſe with a good Chriſtian, for as the Handi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crafts man who hath work'd all the day in his Shop, and the Husbandman, who hath wearied himſelf in following his Plow, lays himſelf down at night in peace, ſo it is with a good Chriſtian, who hath carefully attended the works of Piety and Mercy in this life; he ſleeps his laſt ſleep with a great quiet of mind and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:41646:78" rendition="simple:additions"/>of ſoul, as righteous <hi>Jacob,</hi> when he travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a journey to his Mothers friends, with his Fathers command, was not frighted to behold the Sun go down, although he was in the midſt of an open field, <hi>Gen.</hi> 28. but he laid himſelf down in peace, and ſlept ſweetly, having no other Bed but the Earth, no other Pillow but a Stone, no other covering than the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, nor other Curtains, than the dark ſhadows of the night. Likewiſe a Soul ſanctified by the Spirit of God that walks in all the Commands of his Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Father ſhall never be aſtoniſhed; for whereſoever his Sun goes down, whereſoever Death Arreſts him, he will look upon himſelf as in another <hi>Bethel;</hi> he will ſleep quietly in the Lord Jeſus, in the moſt cruel death, he will feel unſpeakable and glorious joys, and a Peace of God which paſſeth all underſtanding, <hi>Acts</hi> 23.</p>
            <p>We may take notice of this bleſſed diſpoſition in the Apoſtle <hi>St. Paul,</hi> who had behaved himſelf with a good conſcience towards God and towards Man, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. He had labor'd more in his Miniſtry, than all the other Apoſtles, therefore he ſtands in no fear of deaths approaches, but rather we may ſee him full of expectation, and deſires to paſs through Death in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Glory, and Eternal Felicity. This diſpoſition is no leſs remarkble in <hi>Stephen,</hi> the firſt Martyr of Chriſt, <hi>Acts</hi> 6. in the midſt of his moſt grievous torments, he had a countenance ſhining, as that of an Angel, which was a certain teſtimony of his inward peace of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and of the extraordinary joy of his Soul, for as the Wiſe man informs us, <hi>A merry Heart maketh a chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Countenance,</hi> Prov. 15. From the ſame wiſdom pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds this other Oracle that foretels unto every one what ſhall happen unto him. <hi>The wicked is driven away in his wickedneſs, but the righteous hath hope in his death,</hi> Prov. 14. Eccl. 1. Unto this is agreeable the excellent ſaying of Jeſus the Son of <hi>Syrach, It ſhall be well at the
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:41646:78" rendition="simple:additions"/>laſt with him who fears God, he ſhall ſind favor at the day of his death.</hi> This life is but a moment that flies away apace, and yet it determines our Eternal Eſtate; it raiſeth us to the higheſt Glory of Heaven, or elſe it caſts us headlong into the deepeſt Abyſſe of Eternal Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, for what Man ſoweth that ſhall he reap, he that ſoweth in the fleſh ſhall reap, of the fleſh, corruption, but he that ſoweth in the Spirit ſhall reap, of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, Eternal Life.</p>
            <p>If you are afraid of a cruel and unhappy death, keep your ſelves from an evil and a prophane life, for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly, as Man's life is, ſo is his death. The moſt part of thoſe who live in foul Luſts and Prophaneſs, dye in hardneſs of heart, or in grievous deſpair. God's patience, wearied out, changes it ſelf into a juſt reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and fury: Commonly God leaves at the hour of death, ſuch as have left him in the courſe of their lives; he is inexorable to the cryes and ſighs of ſuch as have ſhut their Ears and Hearts to his Holy Word, and his Fatherly Inſtructions; he laughs at the horrid fears and moſt ſenſible torments of thoſe that trample upon his ſacred Commands, according to his own words, <hi>Becauſe I have called and ye refuſed, I have ſtretched out my hand, and no man regarded, but ye have ſet at naught all my counſel, and would none of my reproof, I alſo will laugh at your calamity, I will mock when your fear cometh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>King <hi>Ahab</hi> was deſirous to hear a pleaſing Prophecy of happy things, of the victory over the <hi>Syrian</hi> Army; nevertheleſs he did continue in his Impieties and Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny; therefore the Prophet <hi>Micah</hi> was not afraid of his diſpleaſure, but tells him boldly of the approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Judgments of God, which did hang over his guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Head: likewiſe ſome ſinners deſire to be flatter'd and ſoothed up in their extravagancies, they expect, notwithſtanding their crimes, declarations of Joy and Proſperity: but we ſhould be falſe Prophets, poſſeſſed with a lying Spirit, if we did not foretel to ſuch peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:41646:79" rendition="simple:additions"/>that a moſt lamentable and miſerable death, haſtens apace upon them, we ſhould have a cruel charity for them, if we did not labor to ſave them by fear, as out of a fire; if we did not ſhew them Hell with its jaws open ready to ſwallow them up, and the Eternal Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments wherewith God will puniſh all impenitent and hardened ſinners. Knowing what God's vengeance is, we muſt perſwade Men to embrace Faith and Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, and if we did fail in this our duty, their Blood ſhould be required at our hands.</p>
            <p>To what purpoſe have the Heathen Philoſophers diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed ſo Learnedly of the ſhortneſs of our life? To what purpoſe have many of their Princes entertain'd things on purpoſe to mind them of their mortal conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? Such kind of thoughts did fly in their fancy, but they reapt but little benefit from them, becauſe they did not oblige them to an Holy and Reformed Life, and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence they did not prepare them to a bleſſed Death. It was alſo to no purpoſe that <hi>Balaam</hi> deſired ſo paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onately to dye the death of the Righteous, and that his laſt end might be like a juſt man's, <hi>Numb.</hi> 23. for becauſe he lived the life of a ſinner, and continued in his Abominations and Idolatry, <hi>Numb.</hi> 31. therefore he died as they, and was comprehended in their pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment; as he was a partner in their crimes, it was but juſt and reaſonable that he ſhould ſhare in their calamities, and be a partaker of their torments.</p>
            <p>To abandon Vice and Sin, is to take from Death its Venom, and all its fiery Darts. It is to pluck from this furious Beaſt, its Teeth and Claws; it is to break the Cords and Chains by which the Devil drags us into Eternal damnation. It is to deſtroy the Monſters that fright us, and ſtifle the Furies that purſue us In ſhort, it tends, to change Hell and its grievous Torments into an Heaven and its Glory. There was never yet any perſon that lived an Holy and Religious Life, but he died happily in the favour of his God. Now that the
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:41646:79" rendition="simple:additions"/>Lord knocks, open unto him the door of your hearts, and at the hour of Death he will open unto you the Gates of Heaven; preſent, and give unto him, whiles you are alive, your Bodies and Souls, and doubtleſs he will accept them, and confirm the Gift with his own Seal; here below he will enrich you with his Graces, and crown you at laſt with his Glory, <hi>Bleſſed are they that dye in the Lord,</hi> but to dye in the Lord we muſt live to the Lord, that we may be able to ſay with <hi>St. Paul, Whether we live we live to the Lord, whether we dye we dye to the Lord, whether we live or dye we are the Lords.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To perſwade us to this Religious Duty, we muſt conſider in the firſt place, the Command that he gives us of loving him, fearing him, of repenting of our ſins, and of walking in his Holy ways; unto this he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts us in the Holy Writings of the Old Teſtament, as in the 6 of <hi>Deuteronomy, Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, with all thy ſoul, and with all thy might.</hi> And in the 26 of <hi>Iſaiah, Sanctify the Lord of Hoſts himſelf, and let him be your fear and your dread,</hi> and in the 55 Chap. <hi>Let the wicked forſake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts, and let him return unto the Lord, and he will have mercy upon him, and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon.</hi> In the 2 Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Joel. Turn ye to the Lord with all your heart, and with faſting, and with weeping, and with mourning.</hi> And in the 1 Chapter of <hi>Malachi,</hi> The Son Honors the Father and the Servant his Lord; <hi>If therefore I am your Father, where is the Honor due unto me? If I am your Lord, where is the fear of my Name?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Jeſus Chriſt is not come to aboliſh the Law, but to fulfil it, <hi>Matt.</hi> 5. Therefore in the New Teſtament, he calls upon us as frequently to ſtudy Piety and Vertue. As in the 5 Chapter of <hi>St. Matthew, Let your Light ſo ſhine before Men, that they ſeeing your good Works, may Glorify your Father which is in Heaven.</hi> And in the

            <p n="3">3. God doth not only Command us to apply our ſelves to Holineſs, Juſtice, and Innocency of life, but he propoſes himſelf alſo for our example, That as the obedient and good Children delight to imitate their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Vertues, we alſo might endeavour to coppy out in our lives, the Divine perfections of our Heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and imprint in our Hearts his Sacred Image;
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:41646:80" rendition="simple:additions"/>Therefore in the 11 <hi>Levit.</hi> he tels us, <hi>Be ye Holy, for I am Holy.</hi> And <hi>St. Peter</hi> repeats the ſame paſſage in this manner, <hi>As he that calleth you is Holy, ſo be ye alſo Holy in all manner of converſation, for it is written, be ye Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for I am Holy.</hi> 1 Pet, 2. And our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt gives us the ſame Leſſon. <hi>Love your Enemies bleſs thoſe that curſe you, do good to them that hate you, pray for them that perſecute you, that you may be the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of your Father that is in Heaven,</hi> Matth. 5. for he cauſeth his Sun to riſe upon the good and the bad, and ſends his Rain upon the juſt and the unjuſt, be there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore perfect as your Father in Heaven is perfect. The Apoſtle <hi>St. Paul</hi> ſpeaks in the ſame manner to the <hi>Epheſians; Be followers of God as dear children, put off the old man, and put on the new man, which is created according to God in juſtice and true holineſs.</hi> Chap. 5. And in the 3 <hi>Coloſſ. Now put off all theſe, Anger, Wrath, Malice, Blaſphemy, filthy Communication out of your mouth.

            </p>
            <p n="4">4. Meditate ſeriouſly upon the excellent and preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous promiſes that God hath given to ſuch as addict themſelves to Piety and good Works. As in the 20 <hi>Ex. I ſhew mercy unto thouſand generations of them that love me and keep my Commandments.</hi> And in 1 Sam. 2 Chap. <hi>I will honor them that honor me.</hi> And in the 3 of <hi>Iſaiah, Says to the Righteous, that it ſhall be well with them, for they ſhall eat the fruit of their doings.</hi> And in the 5 of <hi>St. Matthew,</hi> our Saviour ſaith, <hi>Bleſſed are the clean of heart, for they ſhall ſee God,</hi> and in the 6 Chapter, <hi>Seek firſt the kingdom of God and its Righteouſneſs, and all theſe things ſhall be added unto you over and above,</hi> And in the 7 Chapt. <hi>Whoſoever ſhall call me Lord ſhall not enter into the Kingdom of Heaven, but he that doth the will of my Father which is in Heaven. St. Paul</hi> ſpeaks thus to
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:41646:81" rendition="simple:additions"/>the <hi>Romans, If by the Spirit you mortify the deeds of the fleſh you ſhall live,</hi> Chap. 8. And in the 1 Ep. to <hi>Tim. Piety or Godlineſs is profitable unto all things, having the promiſes of this preſent life, and of that which is to come.</hi> And in the 21 <hi>Revel.

            </p>
            <p n="5">5. Conſider that the whole World trembles at the denunciation of the judgements with which God threatens to puniſh all impenitent Sinners, as in <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. <hi>I am the Lord thy God, ſtrong, jealous, viſiting the ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of the Fathers, upon the Children, unto the third and fourth generations of them that hate me.</hi> And in 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2 Chap. <hi>I will honor them that honor me, and will deſpiſe them that honor me,</hi> And <hi>St. Matt.</hi> Chap. 12. <hi>Of every idle word that men ſhall ſpeak, they ſhall give an account at the day of judgement.</hi> And <hi>St. John,</hi> Chap. 3. <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept a man be born of Water and of the Spirit,</hi> that is, of a Spirit purifying like water, <hi>he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.</hi> And in <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. <hi>They who are in the fleſh cannot pleaſe God.</hi> And in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> Chap. 6. <hi>Be not deceived, neither Fornicators nor Idolaters, nor Adulterers, nor Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feminate, nor Abuſers of themſelves with Mankind, nor Thieves, nor Covetous, nor Drunkards, nor Revilers, nor Extortioners, ſhall inherit the kingdom of God.</hi> And the Apoſtle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> is not content to tell us, <hi>That without Holineſs no man ſhall ſee God,</hi> but he ſaith ſomething more; That if we ſin wilfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth, there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains no more ſacrifice for ſin, but a terrible expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of judgement, and fiery indignation which ſhall devour the adverſaries, for our God is a conſuming fire. <hi>Chap.</hi> 10. And in the <hi>Revelations</hi> it is not only ſaid, that in the Holy <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> there ſhall no unclean thing enter, or that committeth Abomination, or a Lye, and that God will ſhut out the Dogs, the Witches, the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicators, the Murderers, the Idolaters, and whoſoever
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:41646:81" rendition="simple:additions"/>doth love, or do a lye, <hi>Chap.</hi> 2.22. But the Spirit of God aſſures, that the timerous, that is ſuch as are more afraid of Man than of God, the Unbelieving, the Execrable, and Murderers, the Fornicators and Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, the Idolaters and Lyers ſhall have their portion in the Lake that burnes with Fire and Brimſtone, which is the ſecond death, <hi>Chap.</hi> 13.</p>
            <p n="6">6. When we ſhould ſpeak the language of Angels, when we ſhould give all our Goods to nouriſh the Poor, and when we ſhould give our Body to be burn'd, if we have not charity, we are but like the ſounding Braſs, and like the thinkling Cymbal. When we ſhould be able to perform Signes and Wonders, if we be not cloathed with Innocency and Holineſs, if we be not adorned with Meekneſs and Love, Chriſt will at laſt treat us as the fooliſh Virgins with a <hi>Depart from me I know you not.</hi> When we ſhould be able to caſt the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil out of other Men, it will avail us nothing, unleſs we can caſt him out alſo of our own hearts, with all the wicked Luſts that he nouriſheth there. To what purpoſe ſhall ſuch cry out at the great day? <hi>Lord, Lord, have not we propheſied in thy name? have not we caſt out Devils in thy name? have not we done many mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles in thy name?</hi> Jeſus will return them this ſad an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, <hi>Depart from me ye workers of iniquity.</hi>

Let us always have before our eyes the bleſſed examples of ſo many Saints, who have traced us the way to Heaven, by their Piety and good Works, they are enter'd into the Paradiſe of God, and the Glory of his Kingdom. It is reported of a Painter, that when he had a deſigne to repreſent an accompliſhed Beauty, he borrowed from divers Objects the Excellencies and Perfections with which he was to adorn his Picture, from the Lillies he took their whiteneſs, from the Roſes their red tincture, from another Object the wonder of the Eye, from another the coral of the Lips, and ſo of the other parts. Likewiſe to reſtore in our Souls the Image of God defaced by ſin, we muſt borrow the Vertues and Excellencies of former Men; for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, Repreſent always to your ſelves <hi>Abel's</hi> Innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, <hi>Henoch's</hi> Holy life, <hi>Noah's</hi> Juſtice, <hi>Abraham's</hi> Faith, <hi>Lot's</hi> Hoſpitality, <hi>Iſaack's</hi> Obedience, the Faithfulneſs of <hi>Jacob,</hi> the Chaſtity of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> the Patience of <hi>Job,</hi> the Meckneſs of <hi>Moſes,</hi> the Zeal of <hi>Phineas,</hi> the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy of <hi>David,</hi> the Wiſdom of <hi>Solomon,</hi> the Piety of <hi>Joſias,</hi> the Prayers of <hi>Daniel,</hi> the Tears of <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> the Faſtings of <hi>Heſter,</hi> the Holy Earneſtneſs of the Woman of <hi>Canaan,</hi> the Devotion of <hi>Cornelius,</hi> the Charity of the <hi>Samaritan,</hi> the Alms of <hi>Dorcas,</hi> and of the poor Widow, the <hi>Publicans</hi> Humility, the good Thiefs Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, the Tears of <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> the Weepings of <hi>Peter,</hi> the undaunted Courage of <hi>St. Paul,</hi> and his indefatigable diſpoſition, and the glorious Martyrdom of <hi>St, Stephen,</hi> and of ſo many noble Souls, of all Ages and Sexes, who have gone to the torments with as much joy, as to Feaſts and to Triumphs; and who have ſealed with their Blood the truth of the Goſpel, with an undaunted reſolution.

Chiefly, Let us look to Jeſus the Author and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſher of our Faith, for he hath left us an example that we might follow his footſteps; All the Vertues that we admire in theſe faithful Souls, are but like ſo many lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle beams of the Sun of Righteouſneſs, and a weak Image of his Glory. There is no Fire ſo perfect, but it ſends up a Smoak, nor Righteouſneſs ſo accompliſh'd, but hath its Imperfections, whiles we are cloathed with this weak fleſh. The behaviour of the moſt Holy and Perfect, is defiled by many infirmities; but our Lord and Saviour is the Lamb without ſpot or ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh, in whoſe Mouth there is no guile; for it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary that we ſhould have ſuch an High Prieſt, who is Holy, Blameleſs, ſeparated from Sinners. The per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect image of all Vertues was never found in any mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Man on Earth, but Jeſus Chriſt is the faireſt amongſt the Sons of Men, his Lips are full of Grace, in him alone we have a perfect model of all Vertues, and of all Perfections that we can imagine. Therefore when the Apoſtle had perſwaded the <hi>Romans</hi> to renounce the Luſts of the Fleſh, Drunkenneſs, Anger, Envy, and ſuch like ſins, inſtead of making an enumeratiun of the Vertues oppoſite to theſe Vices, he thinks it ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to propoſe Chriſt's Holy example, <hi>Put on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> ſaith he, to teach us, that all the Vertues and Graces do enter and meet in the Sacred Perſon of our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, in the higheſt degree of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</p>
            <p n="10">10. We are ſo much the more obliged to imitate Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, and to imprint in our hearts his Holy Image, becauſe that he is not only our Father, our Lord, and our King, but he is alſo the bleſſed Head of that Body, whereof we are Members; It is not juſt to unite de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed and profane Members to an Head ſo Glorious, and ſo Holy; Whoſoever gives himſelf over to his Luſt and Delights, in the corruption of ſin, maimes, as much in him lies, the Sacred Body of the Son of God.

His eyes are ſo clean and pure, that they cannot ſuffer the ſight of iniquity and ſin; it is that which doth moſt afflict and grieve him; Therefore when <hi>St. Paul</hi> had advis'd the <hi>Epheſians, That no corrupt Communicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſhould proceed out of their mouth, but that which is good, to the uſe of edifying, that it may miniſter Grace un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the hearers,</hi> he adds immediately after, <hi>Grieve not the Holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are ſealed unto the day of redemption.</hi> And if there be any that are not moved with the preſence of ſuch a Glorious Perſon, let him tremble at this fearful threatening, <hi>If any deſtroy the Temple of God, God will deſtroy him,</hi> 1 Cor. 3.</p>

Let us repreſent to our ſelves continually, the great and many Obligations that we have to fear God, to love him, and to ſerve him; he is the moſt perfect of all Beings, he is perfection it ſelf, infinitely lovely, ſo that if there were neither Hell to puniſh us, nor Heaven to reward us, he ought to be ſerved and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verenc'd, becauſe of Himſelf, and of his Divine Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections.

Let us therefore ſeriouſly conſider the Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings and Favors which we have received from this great God, who hath created us in his own Image, and who hath made us to be the Maſter-pieces of all his inferior Wonders. He hath placed in us a breviation of all the Beauties and Perfections of the World, he hath given us a Being, as to the Sun, Moon, and Stars. A Life like the Plants, Sence as to the Animals, Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding as to the Angels. In ſhort, he hath infuſed into this Body, faſhioned with his own fingers an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal Soul of an Heavenly Subſtance, a beam of his Glory, and a living Image of his Godhead.

To perſwade us that there is nothing like to this hidden Manna, to this ſpiritual Food, that the world knows not, and to theſe Angeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal and Divine Pleaſures, the Holy Apoſtles inform us, that it is an unſpeakable and glorious Joy, and a peace of God that paſſeth all underſtanding, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.</p>
            <p n="34">34. If any Delight or Pleaſure accompanies Vice, it is but in appearance ſuperficial, as a dream it vaniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth away, for the Triumph of the wicked is of a ſhort continuance, and the Joy of the hypocrite is but for a moment. There is always ſome Thorn, ſome Grief hidden, and ſecret in their laughter, their Heart is afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and their Joy is cut off by Sorrow, <hi>Prov.</hi> 14.</p>

            <p n="35">35. But the Holy Joys and Celeſtial Delights of one that fears God, and that worſhips him in purity and innocency of life, are ſolid and laſting, they caſt a deep Root into the very bottom of our hearts, and enter into the Joynts and Marrow, and diſperſe themſelves all over the inward parts. The Gibbets, the Wheels, <note place="margin">It is the French cuſtome to break notable offenders upon a Cart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wheel.</note> and the moſt grievous torments of this life, cannot pluck theſe joys from us, but they comfort the ſoul in the midſt of the greateſt diſtreſſes, and heal up the broken bones.</p>
            <p n="36">36. The Worldlings become weary, tired with the accompliſhment of their Luſts, and are afflicted at their greateſt ſucceſs, they loath at laſt, all their carnal ſports, and their greateſt ſweetneſs turns into bitterneſs; we grow out of taſte with the pleaſures of ſin, ſo that we begin to loath and abhorr them. It is what <hi>Zophar</hi> intends to ſhew us, when ſpeaking of the wicked, he ſaith, <hi>His meat in his Bowels is turned, it is the gall of Aspes within him, he hath ſwallowed down Riches, and he ſhall vomit them up again, God ſhall caſt them out of his belly,</hi> Job 20.</p>
            <p n="37">37. It is otherwiſe with them who apply their hearts to the fear and ſervice of God, and that find his Yoak eaſy and his burden Light, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11. They take great ſatisfaction in the ways of Righteouſneſs, they run with an holy freedom to their happy end, and to the price of their ſpiritual Calling, the more they drink of the Waters of <hi>Siloah,</hi> the more they thirſt; their Zeal is like an Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Fire, that never ſaith that it is enough, <hi>Prov.</hi> 10. As the Prophet <hi>Moſes,</hi> after that he had been 40 days and 40 nights converſing with God in his Holy Mountain, came down with a Glorious Countenance, ſhining as bright as the Light, with two Tables of the Law in his hands, Likewiſe a Chriſtian Soul that hath bin lifted up to God by fervent Prayers, and bin converſing with him in devout Meditations, cannot hide its ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:41646:88" rendition="simple:additions"/>Joys, and its unſpeakable Delights; it burns with an earneſt deſire of glorifying God, and of pleaſing him in all things; when the Apoſtle <hi>St Peter</hi> ſaw our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour transfigured upon Mount <hi>Tabor,</hi> he was raviſh'd and tranſported in ſuch a manner, that he cryed out, <hi>Lord, it is good for us to dwell here, let us make three Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacles;</hi> Thus the good Chriſtian who is enlightned from above, is never weary in the company of his God, when he ſhould live ſeveral ages, he would not believe that he hath too much time to ſerve his Creator, to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip his Divine Majeſty, and to refreſh himſelf with the unſpeakable pleaſures of his preſence. As the time of <hi>Jacob</hi>'s ſervice ſeem'd to him but a few days, becauſe of the love that he had for <hi>Rachel;</hi> thus the days that we ſpend in the ſervice of God, ſeem to be but of a few hours or moments, in caſe our love for God be earneſt and ſincere.</p>
            <p n="38">38. Repreſent unto your ſelves the fearful curſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced againſt the wicked and the prophane, <hi>Gen.</hi> 29. they carry about them every where the Works of God's anger, and juſt revenge; they are the objects of his hatred, and execrable to the publick; they who flatter and fawn upon them moſt for their own advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, do abominate and curſe them in the bottom of their hearts; and they who out of a ſervile fear, ſeem to honor and worſhip them in the light of the Sun, would be many times very joyful to dance upon their Graves, and erect a Gallows to hang them thereon.</p>
            <p n="39">39. It is not ſo with good Men; they are honoured by God and Man, and their greateſt Enemies admire their Vertues; let us be never ſo poor and contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in the World, we are rich, and noble enough, if we fear God as we ought, and obey his Holy Will, for the fear of the Lord is our chief Treaſure, it is our Crown, our Diadem, and our greateſt Ornament,</p>
            <p n="40">40. The wicked Man is frighted and troubled of his own accord, he trembles in the midſt of his Guards,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:41646:89" rendition="simple:additions"/>and he flies when no man purſues, all things ſcare him, he is jealous, and diſtruſts his beſt friends, his Children are ſuſpected, and in the embraces of his deareſt Wife, he ſlumbers with an unquiet Soul.</p>
            <p n="41">41. It is otherwiſe with a good Man, he marcheth every where with an Head lifted up, and his Heart re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyceth in a perfect tranquility of mind, for there is no Bulwark like that of a good Conſcience; it is like a Wall of Braſs, that abides and withſtands the injuries of the times and ſeaſons; He that fears God, is free from all other fears, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 125. The finger of God that hath ſetled in his Soul, the dread of his Holy Name; baniſheth all other apprehenſions, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 112. He is like Mount <hi>Sion</hi> that cannot be moved, he fears no ill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, his Soul is firmly ſetled upon God; in the midſt of his greateſt dangers, and violent ſtorms, he ſaith with <hi>David, The Lord is my light and my deliverance, of whom ſhould I be afraid? the Lord is the ſtrength of my life, whom then ſhould I fear? O God, thou art a Buckler round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout me, my Glory, and the lifter up of my Head, I have laid my ſelf down, I have ſlept, and I have awak'd, for the Lord upholds me, I will not fear thouſands of People when they ſhould ſett themſelves round about againſt me, when a whole Army ſhould camp againſt me, my heart would never fear.</hi> Pſal. 117.</p>
            <p n="42">42, Let the wicked be never ſo great and honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and never ſo highly advanc'd in the world, their Fame ſhall periſh Eternally. 'Tis to no purpoſe that they rear up ſtately Trophies, and fill whole Volumes with the remarkable paſſages of their lives, making the Marbles to ſpeak forth their Praiſes, whatſoever they do, to render their Glory Eternal, their name ſhall be always abominable to God, and all his Holy Angels, and Mankind ſhall never remember it, but with curſes and deteſtation: theſe infamous perſons are like unto a ſtinking Lamp, that gives light for a time, but when it is put out, it leaves a moſt odious ſtink; they
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:41646:89" rendition="simple:additions"/>may be alſo compar'd to certain Devils that never go out of a place, without cauſing an ill ſmell to be behind them.</p>
            <p n="43">43. It is otherwiſe with good Men, their Fame ſhall flouriſh for ever, and like the Palm, the more Men preſs it down, the more it will riſe, their name is Engra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in Heaven it ſelf, in the Glorious Temple of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, it ſhall always be bleſſed by God and the Angels of his Glory, and the example of their Chriſtian Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues ſhall remain after them, for a Model for their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity, to imitate a faithful Chriſtian; whoſe Soul is ſanctified by the Spirit of the Lord Jeſus, is like to the Alablaſter-box af Ointment, which when it was bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, ſpilt upon our Saviour's Head a precious Liquor that perfum'd all the room, for ſuch an one lives after his death; when his Body is broken and reduc'd to Aſhes, his good name ſpreads abroad, to the Glory of God, and the edification of his Church. <hi>Mary Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalene's</hi> Perfume filled only the Chamber where they were ſitting, and was ſoon ſpent; but the good Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fume of an innocent and Holy life, fills both Heaven and Earth, with a ſweet ſcent, and continues for ever and ever.</p>
            <p n="44">44. I judge that another powerful means to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw us from Vice, and to induce us to Vertue, is to repreſent unto our ſelves at every moment, the Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency and Dignity of our Calling, to take a delight in beholding with the Eyes of our Soul, the white Stone where our new Name is written, which none know<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>, but he who receives it. It is the noble and high quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Children of God, and of Believers, which he beſtows upon none, but upon ſuch whom he hath elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from all Eternity, for the eternal enjoyment of Bliſs in his glorious Kingdom; It is reported of a certain young Prince, that when he had a deſigne to diſgrace himſelf by luſtful actions and debauchery, a wiſe Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:41646:90" rendition="simple:additions"/>reclaim'd him from his wicked purpoſe, by telling him, <hi>Remember that thou art a Kings Son.</hi> Thus you Chriſtian Souls, when Satan, the Fleſh, and the World, ſhall tempt you to filthy and unjuſt actions, or to any other ſin, call to your remembrance, that you are the Children of the King of Kings. Take heed you defile not ſuch a precious Crown; and as our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our ſaid to him who ſhould have followed him, but was deſirous firſt to go and bury his Father, <hi>ſuffer the dead to bury the dead;</hi> likewiſe we ſay unto you devout Souls, who have conſecrated your ſelves willingly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, and to his Service and Worſhip; caſt away theſe vain and baſe actions, and all theſe dead works, leave them to ſuch as are dead in their treſpaſſes and ſins; but for you, behave your ſelves according to your Celeſtial Calling, and apply your ſelves to Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Holineſs, and to the practice of all other Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, as ſuch who were dead, but now are made alive.</p>
            <p n="45">45. We muſt continually meditate upon the Holineſs and Purity of our future abode in Heaven, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation that we have there, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6 For as Jeſus Chriſt is gone to prepare a place for us, in the Houſe of his Heavenly Father, <hi>John</hi> 14. It is but juſt and reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able that we ſhould fit and prepare our Souls for ſuch Holy and Glorious Manſions, <hi>Revel.</hi> 21. It is not poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to go to Heaven by treading the paths of Hell. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing impure nor filthy, ſhall enter into the Holy City, which is the new <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi> As in <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Temple, there was no way to the Holy of Holies, but through the Sanctuary, thus if we will one day enter into the Heavenly Sanctuary where Chriſt dwells, the true Ark of the Covenant, and the Mercy ſeat, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. It is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely neceſſary, that we ſhould tread in the paths of good Works, which God hath prepared, that we ſhould walk in them, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. It is upon this conſideration, that <hi>St. Paul</hi> grounds this exhortation to Piety and Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Vertues, <hi>The Grace of God that bringeth Salvation,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:41646:90" rendition="simple:additions"/>hath appeared to all Men, teaching us, that denying un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlines and worldly luſts, we ſhould live ſoberly righteouſly, and godly in this preſent world, looking for that bleſſed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt who gave himſelf for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity and purify unto himſelf a peculiar people, zealous of good Works; ſeeing that we have ſuch promiſes, let us cleanſe our ſelves from all filth of the Body, and of the Spirit, finiſhing our Sanctification in the fear of God.</hi> 1 Cor. 7. <hi>St. John</hi> makes uſe of the ſame reaſon, to perſwade us to Holineſs, <hi>Beloved, we are now the Children of God, but what we ſhall be, doth not yet appear; now we know, that when he ſhall appear, we ſhall be madè like unto him, for we ſhall ſee him as he is, and whoſoever hath this hope in him, let him purify himſelf as he is pure,</hi> 1 Joh. 2. The Apoſtle <hi>St. Peter</hi> employs the ſame conſideration, to kindle in our hearts this pure and celeſtial fire, <hi>We, according to his promiſe, look for new Heavens, and new Earth, wherein dwelleth Righteouſneſs; wherefore beloved, ſeeing that ye look for ſuch things, be diligent, that ye may be found of him in peace without ſpot and blameleſs,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.</p>
            <p n="46">46. You know Chriſtians, that God created our firſt Parents, in his own Image, and Likeneſs, before that he brought them into his own terreſtial Paradiſe; there is a greater reaſon, that this Divine Image ſhould be imprinted in our Souls, before we enter into the Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtial Paradiſe; unto this the Apoſtle hath a regard when he tells the <hi>Epheſians, be ye renewed in the Spirit of your mind, and put on the new Man, created according to God in Righteouſneſs and true Holineſs,</hi> Chap. 4.</p>
            <p n="47">47. If the place of our future Abode, unto which we are deſigned, doth require from us Sanctification, the quality of the perſons, with whom we ſhall ſpend an Eternity doth no leſs oblige us to the ſame beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, for they ſhall be Angels of Light, and the Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Saints who have waſh'd and whitened their Robes, in the Bloud of the Lamb, <hi>Revel.</hi> 5. It is a glorious
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:41646:91" rendition="simple:additions"/>Church that hath neither ſpot nor wrinkle, nor any ſuch thing, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. It is the Spouſe of the Son of God, cloathed in fine Linnen, clean and white, which are the Righteouſneſs of the Saints, <hi>Revel.</hi> 19. <hi>St. Paul</hi> had this ſame conſideration, when he ſaith, <hi>That we are fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Citizens with the Saints, and of the Houſhold of God,</hi> and <hi>That our converſation ought to be as becometh Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens of Heaven,</hi> To wean us from the filthy Deeds of the Fleſh, and from the prophane diſpoſition of <hi>Eſau,</hi> he employs the ſame reaſon to perſwade us, in the 12 of the <hi>Heb. You are come,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>to the Mount Sion, to the City of the living God, to the Celeſtial Jeruſalem, to the thouſands of Angels, and to the Aſſembly and Church of the firſt-born, who are written in Heaven, and to the Spirits of the Juſt ſanctified.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="48">48. As it is with a Child in his Mothers womb, he begins to live there the ſame life, that he leads when he is come into the World; likewiſe the Chriſtian ought to begin to live in the ſame manner upon earth, as he hopes to live for ever in Heaven; if we will live and Reign with Chriſt above in his Kingdom, we muſt at preſent have him Live and Reign in our Hearts here below by faith.</p>
            <p n="49">49. The chief happineſs of Man conſiſts not only in the true knowldge of God, and of him whom he hath ſent to ſave us, nor in the Spiritual Peace, nor Celeſtial Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports of the Holy Spirit, but it conſiſts in Holineſs, without which none ſhall ſee God, <hi>John</hi> 17. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. Therefore the Apoſtle inquires from the <hi>Romans</hi> of his time, <hi>What fruit had you in thoſe things whereof ye are now aſhamed, but now being free from ſin, and become ſervants of God, ye have your Fruit unto Holineſs, and the end everlaſting life,</hi> Heb. 12. Rom. 6.</p>
            <p n="50">50. I find alſo, that this is a very good remedy to keep our ſelves free from the Debaucheries and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions of the Age, to abſtain from the company and acquaintance of vicious perſons, for as he who did touch
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:41646:91" rendition="simple:additions"/>things unclean, did become thereby unclean, and as ſuch as haunt amongſt the ſick of the Plague, are infect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with their Diſeaſe; Likewiſe it is the property of evil company to corrupt the beſt manners. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.</p>
            <p n="51">51. Whereas we ſhould accuſtom our ſelves to the company and acquaintance of good Men, and Delight in the ſociety of ſuch, who like the Seraphims, excite and enflame one another, to glorify God, and ſing forth his praiſes, we muſt frequent ſuch unto whom we deſire to be like; for as <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Sheep Ewned Lambs, ſpotted and marked, as the Rods upon which they did caſt their eyes; Thus, if we have our joyes fixed upon the Holy examples of Piety and Vertue, we ſhall ſee our ſelves inſenſibly transformed into their Image and Reſemblance; we muſt delight our ſelves in the company of them with whom we hope to live for ever in the higheſt Heavens.</p>
            <p n="52">52. The moſt powerful, and the moſt effectual means to oblige us to the practice of Piety and of Holineſs, and purity of Life, it is to look with the eyes of faith upon him who is inviſible, and to repreſent unto our ſelves the great world as a large Temple where he dwels; Let the voice that came unto <hi>Moſes</hi> out of the burning Buſh, ſound continually in our ears, and in our mind; <hi>Put off thy ſhooes from thy feet, for the place where thou ſtandeſt is holy ground,</hi> Exod. 6. Caſt off there thy baſe and earthly affections, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce thy ſottiſh and filthy Luſts, for thou art al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways before my eyes, that are too clean and pure to ſuffer the ſight of evil, and the place where thou ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt is ſanctified by my preſence, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. Remember that I ſee thine Heart, that I ſearch thy Reins, and that I read thy moſt ſecret thoughts, <hi>Revel.</hi> 2. Chriſtian ſouls imagine that God calls unto you from Heaven continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, as hed id unto <hi>Abraham, Walk before me and be perfect,</hi> Gen. 17. Let therefore the dread of this Divine Majeſty, ſeize upon thee, and poſſeſs thee. When

               <hi>Potiphar</hi>'s Wife tempted chaſte <hi>Joſeph</hi> to defile himſelf with Adultery, ſhe perceived nothing in the room but this object of her Luſt; but this Holy man perceives the Glorious Godhead between him and this laſcivious Woman; he perceives God's Eye, that ſeeth into the greateſt depths: This made him break out into this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, <hi>How can I do this thing and ſin againſt God?</hi> Thus, if our Fleſh tempts us, and if the vicious and prophane intice us into ſecret and ſhameful retreats, to ſhare in their filthy crimes; Let us then remember, that God is every where, and whereſoever we hide our ſelves, God hath an Ear to hear us, an Eye to ſee us, an Hand to record our Deeds, Words, and Thoughts; God is all Ear, all Eye, and all Hand: he diſcovers us as eaſily under the dark ſhadows of the night, as at break of day; he ſpies us through our Fig-leaves, and beholds us in our moſt ſubtle diſguiſes; he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands our moſt inward thoughts, and liſtens to the ſilent language of our Hearts, he ſearcheth into all the Cloſſets of our Souls, and into all the foldings and windings of our Conſciences, In a word, all things are naked, and altogether open to the Eyes of him with whom we have to doe. An antient Philoſopher did per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded ſuch as deſire to be vertuous, to chuſe ſome grave and vertuous perſon, and to repreſent him always in their preſence, and to live as in their ſight, <hi>Seneca.</hi> We need not repreſent unto our ſelves imaginary appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances, for in every place where we are, and what ever we can do or think, we are always in the ſight of the Holy of Holies, who is both our Witneſs and our Judge; It was <hi>David</hi>'s Meditation when he cried out, <hi>O Lord, whither ſhall I go from thy Spirit? or whether ſhall I flye from thy preſence? If I mount up to Heaven thou art there, if I go down into the pit thou art there alſo; if I take the wings of the morning and fly to the uttermoſt parts of the Sea, thither ſhall thine hand guide me, and thy right hand uphold me, If I ſay, the

            <p n="53">53. If the Devil and the World have enſnared us in their Nets, and if we have been unhappily lull'd aſleep in the boſome of ſome deceitful pleaſure. This conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration alone, that God ſees and underſtands us, is able to awake us with an Holy dread and fear, Let there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the words of <hi>St. Paul</hi> ſound continually in our minds, <hi>Awake thou that ſleepeſt and ariſe from the dead, and Chriſt ſhall enlighten thee;</hi> or, <hi>Awake to Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ſin not,</hi> Eph. 5. 1 Cor. 15. Truly if we be not ſtupified and beſotted above meaſure; This dreadful voice that God thunders from Heaven, is able not only to awake us from the ſleep of iniquity, but to oblige us alſo to cry out with <hi>Jacob, God is here, and I knew it not!

Aſſoon as <hi>Peter</hi> had taken notice of our Saviours looks, that were caſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, he went out of the High Prieſts Hall, and wept bitterly, for his Apoſtacy; Thus if we could but perceive and acknowledge, that God caſts his eye con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually upon us, we ſhould repent of our Vices, and our Hearts would quickly melt into Tears of Contrition.</p>
            <p n="54">54. And becauſe it is ſometimes neceſſary to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain our ſelves with an Holy awe, and to withdraw our ſelves out of Luſt, as out of the Fire; you Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Souls, keep always in your mind a ſhort Collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Judgements of God, that have happened from time to time, upon all manner of ſinners; Conſider how God dealt with the Celeſtial Spirits, who have not kept their original purity, they are reſerv'd for ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter darkneſs, and for eternal Chains, until the great day of Judgement, and ſay unto your ſelves, If God hath not ſpared the Apoſtate Angels with he ſpare Man that rebels againſt him, and offends him with delight;

In the day of this glorious coming, the Heavens ſhall melt, the Elements will be diſſolved, the Earth and all its works ſhall be burn'd with fire, and every man ſhall give an account of every idle word, how much more of every wicked action, and prophane diſcourſe? <hi>Matt.</hi> 5.12.</p>
            <p n="56">56. That we may not be confounded nor aſhamed in this fearful day, in which God will judge the world by the man whom he hath ordained; Let us be inwardly perſwaded, that it is not ſufficient to abſtain from out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſins, but we muſt alſo hate, and inwardly abhor them, <hi>Acts</hi> 17. For as the Leopard in Chains leaves not his Skin nor his Spots, and changes not for all his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint his rapacious and cruel nature, for it continues nevertheleſs to be a Leopard; and as a Thief in Fetters ſhut up in a Dungeon, remains a Thief in his heart and diſpoſition; likewiſe ſuch as abſtain from exterior ſins, for fear of Man, and the ſeverity of the Laws are never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs eſteem'd to be vicious and abominable in the ſight of God, and of his Holy Angels; if every time that he thinks upon his crimes, he is not moved with a true contrition, and an inward abhorrency of his ſoul, to abominate them. The beſt means to render our Conſcience whole, is to tear it in pieces with the ſorrows of repentance.</p>
            <p n="57">57. It is not ſufficient to abſtain from the thoughts, words, and actions that God prohibits, but we muſt alſo apply our ſelves to the ſtudy of true Piety, of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and generally of all the good Works that God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires: for as the Praiſe and Honor of a good Bow-man is never beſtowed upon one who hath only the skill of not breaking his Bow, his Arrows, or his Quiver,
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:41646:94" rendition="simple:additions"/>but to him who ſtrikes the mark, and aims well, and he is not to be reckoned a good Artiſt, who works not ill, becauſe he doth nothing at all, but he who works well, and ſhews excellent pieces of worknanſhip: like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe he is not to paſs for a good and Religious Chriſti-who only abſtains from evil, and commits no outward ſins, but he who doth good, and applies himſelf to Vertue: Every Tree that bringeth not forth good Fruit, although it bears no evil Fruit, is hewen down, and caſt in the fire, <hi>Matt.</hi> 2. our Saviour curs'd the Fig-tree, not becauſe that it brought forth evil Fruits, but becauſe it brought forth no good Fruit, but was altogether barren. The wicked ſervant was caſt out in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to utter darkneſs, where there is weeping and gnaſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of teeth, not becauſe he had loſt, or miſpent his Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, but becauſe he had not employed it well, and turned it to his Lords advantage, <hi>Matt.</hi> 25. Not only ſuch ſhall be condemned to the Flames, prepared for the Devil and his Angels, who afflict God's Children on Earth, and ſpill the bloud of his ſervants; but ſuch as have not cloathed his Members, viſited and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted them, nor given them to eat and drink. In ſhort, if you enquire from the rich Miſer, how he comes to be condemned to Hell, tortured in the Flames, he will not tell you it was becauſe he took what was not his own, or becauſe he committed no Murders, Violences, and other horrid Deeds, but becauſe he lived without Charity, and had no pity of the poor.</p>
            <p n="58">58. And becauſe God requires, that we ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed daily forward, until we become to the meaſure of the perfect ſtature in our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, we muſt very frequently take a view of our former life, and feel the pulſe of our Luſts, to ſee whether they be not more fervent and violent than before, whether the old Man continues to decline, and how much we have gain'd upon our wicked affections, and reformed our corrupt diſpoſition; for as thoſe who ſwim againſt
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:41646:94" rendition="simple:additions"/>the ſtream, if they ſlack but a little, are carried down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards by the violence of the Current. Likewiſe if we employ not all our ſtrength to ſwim up to our Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Source, Integrity, and Perfection; the torrent of our Luſts, and of evil Cuſtoms, will hurry us down into the deep Abyſſe of Death, and Eternal Deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; we muſt therefore often examine every day, what progreſs we have made in Piety and Holineſs; and whether ſince ſo many years that God ſpeaks to us and inſtructs us to diſcover to us what is pleaſing to hime if we have more Piety, Zeal and Charity, and mors Holineſs, than before; we muſt imitate the ſolicitou, care of ſuch as have transplanted ſome rare plant of the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> in this <hi>Northern</hi> climate; they have always the eye upon it, to take notice of every thing that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens to it. We muſt propoſe for our example a Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard who hath a great account to make up, he looks of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten upon his Memorials and his Regiſters. An Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Philoſopher was highly prais'd, becauſe he did ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver lay himſelf down to ſleep, until he had well ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amin'd what progreſs he had made in Philoſophy, and Moral Vertue: Likewiſe a good Chriſtian ſhould never caſt himſelf upon his Bed to ſleep at night, until he hath ſeriouſly conſidered how he hath proceeded for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in Piety, and the love of God: In a word, a true Chriſtian by this means ſhall never be leſs alone, than when he is alone; for thon he ſhall entertain him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with his God, and ſhall diſcover unto him his Heart, and his moſt ſecret thoughts, then he ſhall ſpeak ſeriouſly unto his Soul, and ſhall examine exactly his Conſcience, then he will look to his wicked deeds, to weep and lament for them with Tears of a ſincere re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, then he will caſt himſelf upon the infinite Mercy and Goodneſs of his God, to embrace it with a lively Faith and aſſurance; then he will make a reflexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon God's Commands, to walk in them with an Holy Zeal and Earneſtneſs all the days of his life.</p>

            <p n="59">59. Amongſt theſe directions that I intend to give to him that deſires to apply himſelf to the practice of Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, and to abandon Vice; I muſt not forget this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, that he muſt never ſatisfy his carnal Luſts and Pleaſures, but he ſhould rather check and bridle them, for when we grant them what they deſire, we are ſo far from extinguiſhing the feavoriſh Flames, and ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying theſe helliſh longings, that we do but increaſe and encourage them the more; as he that loves Money is not ſatisfied with Money; and as the ambitious is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver exalted high enough in Honor: Thus the luſtful Worldling is never contented with the fulleſt enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the carnal pleaſures; It is a Fire that kindles another, and a Flame that never ſaith. <hi>It is enough.</hi> Theſe filthy Luſts are like the Serpent that ſtings the boſom of the perſon that warms it in his Breaſt; or as the Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace of <hi>Babylon</hi> that burnt up thoſe who had firſt light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it: for ſuch as entertain the Flames of their fleſhly Luſts, they keep in their boſoms a Fire, that will at laſt burn and totally conſume them.</p>
            <p n="60">60. We muſt reſiſt the firſt motions of the Fleſh, and with the ſhield of Faith, extinguiſh the firſt enfla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Darts of the Devil; for as it is very eaſy to put out the firſt ſparkles of an increaſing fire, but if we neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect or cheriſh it, it may come to be a fearful burning, and as we can without pain pluck up with one hand a young Tree planted but a few days, but if we ſuffer it to take root, and to get ſtrength, we ſhall not be able to pluck it up with both our hands, but muſt be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to employ the Axe, the Wedge, and the Sawe. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, if we reſiſt ſin in its beginning, we ſhall eaſily overcome and tame it; we ſhall put out without labor theſe firſt beginnings of a ſtrange fire, and we ſhall pull up with eaſe this bitter plant that will grow to our ſorrow, but if we ſuffer this infernal Fire of Luſt to increaſe all the Water of the Sea will not be able to extinguiſh it, and if we give leave to this curſed Plant
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:41646:95" rendition="simple:additions"/>to grow, it will never be pluckt up without much ſweat and labor; Sin never begins by the ſame means that it ends, and it diſcovers not all its poiſon at once; As the Child in his Mothers Womb is not made in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant: Thus this Monſter of Satan is formed by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, one Chain of Hell is link'd into another, when Luſt hath conceived it brings forth ſin: from the thought proceed the ſuggeſtion, and from the ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion pleaſure and delight, and from delight conſent, and after conſent then follows the deed, which begets the Habit; from thence, the ſinner proceeds to be hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in a cuſtom of ſin; thus the Devil aggravates the yoke of Tyranny, and of our Bondage, and ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens the tye and chains, by which he drags us into eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal damnation.</p>
            <p n="61">61. As amongſt the Planets, there is always one that rules and cauſeth its influences to be felt upon earth, more than the reſt; thus amongſt Sins and Luſts there is always ſome one or other that rules in us, unto which we are more addicted, than to the reſt by a natural propenſity; unto this therefore we muſt chiefly take heed here we muſt declare our ſtrength and induſtry, for fear that the Devil ſhould employ it as a means to enter into our Souls, and eſtabliſh there his Tiranny; we muſt imitate the wiſe and valiant Captains, who having a place to defend againſt a vigilant and an active Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, do fortify the places that are naturally the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, and furniſh them with the beſt Soldiers, cauſing there a watchful and continual Guard to be kept. Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Souls be ſure you take all the Armor of God, that you may be able to reſiſt in the evil day, and having overcome all, that ye may continue ſtedfaſt. <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.</p>
            <p n="62">62. We muſt not neglect any ſin, nor imagine that there are ſome light and unconſiderable, that God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards them not, for a little Leaven, ſeaſons and Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens the whole Lump, and the leaſt dead Fly corrupts and cauſeth ſeveral confections to bubble up and ſpoil.
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:41646:96" rendition="simple:additions"/>The leaſt ſcratch may cauſe a feavoriſh Inflamation, and but little poiſon can lay us in our graves; The Devil cares not by what Gate he enters into our Souls, and by what tye he takes hold of our Hearts; This curſed Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent ſlides through the leaſt, and the narroweſt cranies and holes of the Houſe, as well as through the wideſt Gates. Chriſtian Souls, give not place to the Devil, but ſhut your Ears to all his Enchantments.</p>
            <p n="63">63. We muſt not only eſchew all manner of ſins, and abſtain from all appearance of evil, but for our bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſecurity, that we may not endanger our Salvation, we muſt take heed of all thoſe things whereof our Souls are doubtful, and upon which our conſciences cannot reſolve. We muſt never do any thing, but we muſt be fully perſwaded, that it is acceptable unto God, and agreeable to his Holy Will, for <hi>Whatſoever is done without Faith, is ſin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="64">64. As thoſe who intend to ſtop the currant of a running Water, are wont to cut for it a new Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel and Gutter; Thus if your vicious Luſts and Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions are too violent, you muſt divert them, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe unto your ſelves new and freſh objects: are you Cholerick? be angry and ſin not, fret and fume againſt your own Sins and Luſts, and cruſh in pieces theſe Children of <hi>Babel.</hi> Are you oppreſt with ſadneſs and grief? Let the cauſes of your ſadneſs be your offences againſt God, and the ſcandals of his Church. Are you furious and violent? Remember to be of the number of thoſe bleſſed violent perſons, who raviſh the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God by violence. Are you inclined to Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs? Covet and be greedy for the Riches and Treaſuries of Heaven. <hi>Matt.</hi> 21. Are you lifted up with ambitious thoughts? Let your ambitious aim be to raiſe you upon the immortal Throne, and to attain to the uncorruptible Crowns of Glory. Are you luſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and given to your pleaſures? Labor to enjoy the Divine and raviſhing Delights of the Holy Spirit, and
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:41646:96" rendition="simple:additions"/>meditate often upon the eternal pleaſures that are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved for you in Heaven.</p>
            <p n="65">65. Devout Souls, who ſigh and groan for your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities, who labor to attain to perfection, apply your ſelves to read and meditate upon God's Holy Word, with a Religious attention, and before you enter into this Holy Reading, ſay with the Prophet <hi>David, Lord open mine eyes, and I ſhall ſee the wonders of thy Law,</hi> Pſal. 119. Intreat your good God to open your Hearts as he did <hi>Lydia,</hi> to receive this uncorruptible Seed of your Regeneration, and that he may give you a filial obedience, <hi>Acts</hi> 16. In ſuch a caſe, aſſoon as you ſhall hear the Lord's voice, you will find your Souls enfla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with his Holy Love, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. When we do but only behold a beautiful countenance, we become not more beautiful thereby, nor do we take from it its ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent features, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. but it is otherwiſe with us, who behold as in a Glaſs openly, the Glory of the Lord; we are transformed thereby into the ſame image of his Glory, as by the Spirit of the Lord.</p>
            <p n="66">66. Take pleaſure to meditate often upon God's won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful works, and to ſing forth his Praiſes. The Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Songs inſpired by the Holy Ghoſt, do common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appeaſe all the evil notions of our mind, and beget in us an Holy Joy, and Celeſtial Peace; as when <hi>Saul</hi> was tormented with a wicked Spirit, <hi>David</hi> was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed with his Harp to play before him, and by that means he quieted his troubled mind. Likewiſe when Hatred, Anger, Revenge, Covetouſneſs, Ambition or Luſt, or any other of the unruly paſſions, which are as ſo many evil Spirits that diſturb and torture our Souls within us; we muſt ſeek a remedy from <hi>David</hi>'s Harp, and ſing unto the Lord in Spiritual Songs and Hymns.</p>
            <p n="67">67. We muſt carefully attend at all the publick ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes of Devotion, and not leave off the aſſembling of our ſelves together, as the manner of ſome is; for
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:41646:97" rendition="simple:additions"/>where there are but two or three met together, in the name of Jeſus Chriſt, he is there in the midſt of them. <hi>St. Thomas,</hi> who was not with the Apoſtles when Chriſt firſt appeared amongſt them, loſt the comfort then of ſeeing him riſen from the dead; And if this merciful Redeemer had not had compaſſion of him, he had pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh'd in his unbelief for ever. If upon the day of Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticoſt, any of the faithful had been found abſent from the Holy company of the Faithful in <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> they had not ſeen the Glorious appearance of the Holy Ghoſt; who knows but in a Sermon that we have neglected, we have loſt ſome pious advice, ſome ſeaſonable exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, by which God might have brought our hearts to repentance? Who knows, but inſtead of that Fire that devours us, we might have felt the Holy Flames kindled in us, like unto thoſe Flames of the burning Buſh, that would burn in us and not conſume us? Who knows, but at the breaking up of the Aſſembly, we might have ſaid as the two Diſciples of Chriſt going to <hi>Emaus, Did not our heart burn within us when he ſpoke to us, and opened the Scriptures.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="68">68. We muſt be fervent, zealous, and perſevering in Prayers, and other Holy Duties, and embrace our Lord and Saviour with the Arms of Faith and Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and ſay unto him as <hi>Jacob, I ſhall not leave thee until thou haſt bleſſed me;</hi> eſpecially, we ought to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply our ſelves to theſe bleſſed exerciſes, when we feel the inward and trobleſome ſtruglings of the Fleſh againſt the Spirit; we muſt imitate that Holy and vertuous Woman, who feeling two Children ſtirring in her Womb, fell to her Prayers, and unburdened her ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows in the boſome of our Heavenly Father. And as <hi>St. Peter</hi> when he began to ſink, lifted up his Hands in Prayer, ſaying, <hi>Lord ſave me, Matth.</hi> 14. Likewiſe we who walk upon this dangerous Sea of the World, aſſoon as we feel our ſelves ſinking into the Delights of the World, or aſſoon as the Waves of vicious examples
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:41646:97" rendition="simple:additions"/>and dangerous cuſtoms do hurry us away; Let us cry out from the bottom of our Hearts, O merciful God, ſtretch out thine hand from above, and deliver me from theſe Waters of Hell that carry me away, accompliſh thy vertue in mine infirmities, and give me Grace in reſiſting againſt ſin, to reſiſt unto Blood, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 69. <hi>Heb.</hi> 50. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 22. Let thine Holy Spirit overcome mine let Heaven command the Earth, and let Paradiſe lead Hell in Triumph. If we make this Petition with all our Hearts, God will grant it from his Holy Sanctuary, He will extinguiſh the Fire that burns us, He will ſhut the Lions mouth that intends to devour us, He will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſe the Winds and the Storms that the Devils have raiſed in us, and at his firſt entrance into our Ship, toſt up and down with fears and apprehenſions, he will bring Peace and a bleſſed tranquility, and will lead us to the ſafe Haven of Eternal Happineſs; as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Moſes</hi> when he had been familiar with God, came down from the Mountain with a ſhining countenance; and as our Saviour when he was in Prayer upon Mount <hi>Tabor,</hi> was transfigured, his Garments were white as the Light, and his Face appeared as glorious as the Sun; Likewiſe if we lift up our ſelves above all theſe earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and corruptible things, and pray unto God with an Holy Earneſtneſs and Zeal, we ſhall ſee that our Souls ſhall be thereby cloathed with Holineſs and full of Glory and Light; they will be transformed into the bleſſed Image of the great God whom we adore, for as ſoon as we behold him, we become enlightened.</p>
            <p n="69">69. To the end that we may tame this Body, and reduce it to obedience, and to overcome all our wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and dangerous Luſts, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 69 34. It is neceſſary that we ſhould joyn Faſting to our Prayers; we muſt not always expect a time appointed by the Rulers of our Church upon ſolemn accaſions, but we muſt order unto our ſelves a Faſt, according as we ſhall ſee it expedient and uſeful; for if this Fleſh is unruly, it is rebellious
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:41646:98" rendition="simple:additions"/>againſt God and his Holy Commandements, if be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is fed in Eaſe and Plenty, it is Luſtful, Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure, and Inſolent; Let us cut off from it all its dain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and labor to mortify it by Faſtings and Abſtinence, and remember what our Saviour Chriſt ſaith in the Gospel, <hi>That there are ſome evil ſpirits that are not to be driven out but by Faſting and Prayer,</hi> Matth. 27.</p>
            <p n="70">70. If God gives us the Grace to overcome Sin and weaken our Luſts, by fervent and earneſt Prayers, and by auſtere Faſting, and hot tears of Repentance, and by the aſſiſtance of his Divine Spirit, that will pour his Bleſſings upon our Devotions; take heed that we become not careleſs and negligent in good Works; deceive not your ſelves Religious Souls, and be not ſurprized, for many times the old Man looks as if he were dead, that we might not offer to ſtrike him again to the Heart, and give him the laſt blow, that he may recover more ſtrength; there is always in the Aſhes ſomething of that infernal Fire, that is able to do much miſchief. Luſt is not rooted out ſo perfectly, but that there remains ſome ſtrings in our Hearts that may grow again. This ſource of Iniquity is not ſo dry, but that it may run afreſh. As it is du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the time of Peace; Men exerciſe themſelves in feats of Arms, and prepare new Armor for the War Likewiſe during the calm and reſt of our Souls, we muſt prepare ſome Armor for our Spiritual Warfare; And as it is not ſufficient to win a place by Aſſault, and to have driven out the Enemies Forces, but we muſt alſo watch day and night, and keep a conſtant, and a ſtrong Guard, that we may not be ſurprized and driven out again. Thus when we have forced out the Devil, and baniſh'd him out of our Hearts, we muſt be always upon our Guard, and ſtop all the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues, for fear that this evil Spirit ſhould come up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us, accompanied with ſeven worſe Spirits, and that our laſt condition ſhould be worſe than the firſt.</p>
            <pb n="189" facs="tcp:41646:98" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p n="71">71. To theſe Works of Piety and Devotion, in which we cannot be always employed; we muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member to add a lawful Calling, for Idleneſs is the Mother of all Vices; when we are doing nothing, the Devil prompts us to evil; this happened to <hi>David,</hi> a man after God's own heart, for when he gave himſelf over, contrary to his former practice, to an unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy idleneſs, whilſt he was looking into his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors Houſe, the Devil entred into his Heart, and, by the aſſiſtance of a luſtful Object, inflamed his Soul with an unlawful deſire: as the Iron that is not us'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes Ruſty, as the ſtanding Water putrifies, and as the Earth that is not manur'd, begets inſects and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemous Serpentss. Likewiſe a Soul that is not em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed, is ſoon cover'd over with the ruſt of Vice: It is eaſily drag'd along into the corruption of the age, and apt to beget and bring forth Monſters; therefore the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel</hi> examines the very beginning and firſt ſpring of <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Sin, ſaying,, <hi>That it was the plenty of Bread, Eaſe, and Idleneſs,</hi> Ezek. 16. Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, if you deſire to keep your Souls pure and unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed, that the Holy Spirit may Reign in them, give no entertainment to the Devil, let him find you al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways well employed, and let him never ſee you at lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, to aſſault you with his helliſh temptations, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.</p>
            <p n="72">72. After all, we muſt ſeriouſly think upon death, and repreſent it always before our Eyes; for as a Pilate that will govern and ſteer the courſe of this life as we ought, we muſt conſider our latter end, live always as if we were ready to dye, and to breath forth the laſt gasp; therefore this Sentence is worthy to be Engra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven upon Cedar- in Golden Characters, <hi>What ever thou ſayeſt, or what ever thou doeſt, remember thy latter end, and thou ſhalt never ſin,</hi> Eccl. 7.</p>
            <p>Wonder not, Chriſtian Souls, if in this Treatiſe, where I am to furniſh you with Remedies, againſt the fears of Death; I would have death it ſelf to be a
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:41646:99" rendition="simple:additions"/>Remedy againſt Sin, for theſe things are united and linked together, or rather they hold one another by the hand: for as a good and Holy Life is a ſafe prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to an happy Death. Likewiſe Death is a ſtrong motive to oblige us to live well, for there is none, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it be a brutiſh and a furious Varlot, but at the hour of Death laments at the conſideration of his former wicked Life, and grieves that he hath not applyed himſelf to the fear of God, and to the practice of Chriſtian Vertues. If a Malefactor after that he is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd to dye, and hath heard the Sentence of his doom, did mind nothing but drinking and playing, and neglect Prayer and Repentance, by which ſuch an one is to diſpoſe himſelf, to go to God, every one would wonder at him, as at a Monſter and a Madman, like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe if we conſider as we ought, that Death is certain and unavoidable, and that God hath pronounced the Sentence in his anger, and that not one ſhall be except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; this will be able to withdraw us from Vice, and to perſwade us to Holineſs, without which none ſhall ſee God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. Therefore at every moment, when Satan, the World, our own Fleſh, ſhall ſolicite us to any evil action, let us think within our ſelves, would I have death find and ſeize upon me in this employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? Am I in a good diſpoſition to go thus unto my God, and to appear before his Tribunal? Jeſus the Son of <hi>Syrac</hi> had well conſider'd this when he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounc'd this excellent Sentence, which I could wiſh were engraven in the Soul of every Chriſtian. <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member thy latter end, and thou ſhalt not ſin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We muſt therefore live in the World without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing guilty of its corruptions and abominations: As the Fiſh preſerves its ſweetneſs in the midſt of the Salt Waves of the Sea; and as the Sheep never learn to bark nor to bite, although they be always with Dogs; Likewiſe, although our converſation be in the World amongſt the prophane and vicious Men of this Age,
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:41646:99" rendition="simple:additions"/>we muſt not imitate their filthy Words, their Oaths, their Blaſphemies, and leſs Reaſon have we to follow their wicked and abominable Deeds, we muſt live among them as <hi>Lot</hi> lived in the City of <hi>Sodom,</hi> as <hi>Joſeph</hi> in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> as <hi>Daniel</hi> in <hi>Babylon.</hi> Bleſſed and Holy is he who hath part in the firſt Reſurrection, the ſecond Death ſhall have no power upon him.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Jacob</hi> by God's Command went to <hi>Bethel,</hi> he Commanded his Wives, his Children, and all that were with him. <hi>Put away the ſtrange Gods that are among you, and be clean, and change your Garments, and let us ariſe and go up to Bethel,</hi> Gen. 33. <hi>And I will make there an Altar unto God, who anſwered me in the day of my diſtreſs, and was with me in the way which I went.</hi> Then they delivered into <hi>Jacob</hi>'s hands, all the ſtrange Gods that were in their poſſeſſion, and he hid them under an Oak in <hi>Sechem.</hi> Thus before we go to the true <hi>Bethel,</hi> to the dwelling where we ſhall eat our fill of the Bread of the Kingdom of Heaven. Before you offer unto God the Sacrifice of your Souls, you muſt, if you be true Chriſtians, renounce Sin, and all wicked Luſts, which have been formerly your Idols; I ſhall deſire of you willingly, that you would bury them deep in this baſe Earth, but you had better do as God Commands you from Heaven, <hi>Trample under foot all theſe abominable Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and all theſe worldly Luſts that are to you as ſo many falſe Gods that you worſhip,</hi> Ezek. <hi>Put away from before me theſe Idols of jealouſie that provoke me to jealouſie and ſanctify this Temple of my Holineſs.</hi> Cleanſe your hands ye Sinners, and fanctify your ſelves ye double-minded; put off the Old man with all his Deeds, and put on the New man created according to the Image of God, Righteouſneſs and true Holineſs, and then you ſhall be admitted to the Holy Temple of my Glory, to offer unto me in the innumerable Companies of Saints, the acceptable perfume of Praiſes and Thanſgivings, <hi>Jam.</hi> 4. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.</p>

            <p>This is a Duty ſo juſt and neceſſary, that natural reaſon it ſelf, enlightned by Grace, acknowledges it to be ſo; nay the moſt wretched Varlets are conſtrain'd to give Glory to God, and to condemn themſelves; they confeſs that they are indebted to the Divine Majeſty, but the payment of this debt they put off from day to day, and when ever you come to them, they are ready to demand a delay, they acknowledge their faults, the hainouſneſs of their Crimes, and the neceſſity of Repentance, but they are always putting off Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and Reformation of life; As when a ſluggard is newly awak'd out of his ſleep, he deſires <hi>yet a little ſleep, a little ſlumber, a little folding of the hands to ſleep,</hi> Prov. 24. Thus when ever Death appears, the Volup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous are yet requeſting to enjoy their carnal Delights, when the Lords Meſſengers are calling upon us to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair the breaches that the Devil hath made in our Souls, we could willingly anſwer as the Jews did to the Prophet, <hi>That the time is not come that the Lord's houſe ſhould be built,</hi> Hag. 1. The young man in his Youth and Strength is apt to ſay, that it is not yet time to buſy himſelf about Wiſdom and Reformation, and that when he comes to be old, he will then repent of the ſins of his Youth; and the old man he endeavours to put his Repentance until the hour of his departure: He expects to make then a general confeſſion of all his crimes, to ſatisfy all his neighbors, and to reſtore what he poſſeſſeth ſo unjuſtly. In ſhort, all Men in general do flatter themſelves in their evil courſes, and moſt are ſo extravagant, as to be perſwaded, that when they have lived in ſin and iniquity all their life, miſpent, God's Bleſſings, abuſed his Mercies, a Tear or a Sigh at the time of our Death will make a ſufficient amends for all, and that he will be fully ſatisfied, if we ſay then as the prodigal Child, <hi>My Father, I have ſinned againſt Heaven, and againſt thee.</hi> Or as the good Thief, <hi>Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member me,</hi> Luk 15.

            <p>I have much to ſay againſt ſo great a miſtake, ſo dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous and prophane a perſwaſion; Firſt, what reaſon have we to believe that God will accept our Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, when we cannot endure to accept of his Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Redemption; that he will hear our Sighs, and grant our Prayers, when we will by no means give ear to his voice, nor obey the Command that he ſends us of repenting?</p>
            <p>Wretched Man! doſt thou ſtay to glorify God till the moment when thy breath ſhall fail thee? Is it juſt that thou ſhouldeſt then begin to ſerve him, when thou ſhalt be able to ſerve and pleaſe thy fleſh no long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, nor ſatisfy thy fooliſh Luſts?</p>
            <p>This great God who had Commanded, during the Shadows and Types of <hi>Moſes</hi> Law, that the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhould offer unto him their Firſt-born, and the Firſt-Fruits of their Inheritances, will he take it well now in this admirable Sun-ſhine of the Goſpel, that thou ſhouldeſt offer to the Devil, and to the World, the Firſt-Fruits of thy Youth, the ſtrength of thy years, and that thou ſhouldeſt reſerve for him only the dregs and the corruption of a decaying old age?</p>
            <p>It is to mock God and Man to dream of living well when our life is far ſpent and gone. To lift up our Eyes and Thoughts to Heaven, when the Earth fails us under our feet. To reſtore other mens Goods, when we can keep them no longer. To renounce all deſires of Revenge, when we have no power of being revenge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. To abſtain from the foul Luſts of the Fleſh, when we are able to continue in them no longer, to abhor Theft, Uſury, Rapine, and Extortion when a Coffin is preparing to receive us, and that Death looks us in the Face. Such perſons cannot be ſaid to leave Sin, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Sin leaves them as the Ravens leave a Tree that falls down by age, or that is ſtruck with the Thunder.</p>
            <pb n="194" facs="tcp:41646:101" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p>By our unreaſonable delays, Evil and Sin grow old<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and the cure becomes every day more uneaſy, for the more thou ſhalt be hardened in thy corruption, and confirmed in thy ſins, the harder it will be for thee to break and melt thy corrupted Heart. The more Luſt ſhall have ſunk its Roots in thy Soul, the more labor thou wilt find in plucking them out. In ſhort, he that gives too much liberty to his unlawful affections, makes his Vices, by cuſtom, become natural, and cannot be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted without a great miracle.</p>
            <p>Man's moſt important and difficult affair in the world is his Converſion to God, Therefore it is a notable folly to put it off to ſuch a time as we ſhall be in the feebleſt and weakeſt condition; to a time, when we ſhall have moſt buſineſs to do, and moſt trouble. Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he doth not order his affairs well, who puts off his praying unto God, and his thoughts of Heaven, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til he comes to be ſtretch'd on his death bed, for then we know not to whom we are to turn. An account of our worldly Concerns is then required from us; we are then to make our laſt Will and Teſtament, we call for a Scrivener, and are inwardly vex'd to behold him; the viſit of friends trouble us, and their abſence doth as much diſpleaſe us; Pain doth ſeize upon us, Deflux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions are ready to choake us, Feavers burn us and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb our minds, Phyſitians oppreſs us with unpleaſant Remedies, the noiſe is a trouble to us, and ſilence is ſuſpected; our Parents and Friends torment us by their officious in officiouſneſs, our Children, and our great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Darlings melt our Hearts, and their Tears do force us to weep. But the worſt is, the Devils are then moſt buſy and active. Theſe helliſh Fiends, like the devou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Ravens, fly about us, endeavouring to fright us. In ſhort, it is then that the Prince of the Powers of the Air ſtir up againſt us furious Storms and Tempeſts, to cauſe us to periſh in the very Haven. In the midſt of ſo many diſturbances, and of ſo many powerful Waves,
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:41646:101" rendition="simple:additions"/>it is a difficult task to poſſeſs our Souls in peace, to think upon our Conſciences, to hear God ſpeaking to us to fear death as we ought, and to keep our ſelves from ſinking, and from being ſwallowed up with its ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions and frights.</p>
            <p>Old Age hath infirmities enough, we need not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>file it with youthful Sins and Luſts, for many times it cauſeth more wounds in our Souls, than there are wrinkles upon our Skin. When the Body decays and grows weak, the Luſts of the fleſh become ſtronger, and oft-times when it whitens the Face, it ſpots the Conſcience In a word, The bones of old Age are weak enough, and ſufficiently full of pain, that we need not over-burden them with the ſins committed in the flower and ſtrength of our Age.</p>
            <p>Moreover, we know not when, nor how Death will aſſault us, nor what favor we are to expect from it; who knows but that it intends not to give us the liberty of ſpeaking to our Friends, nor of thinking upon our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, for it ſends not always a warning to us, as to the good King <hi>Hezekiah, Set thine Houſe in order, for thou ſhalt dye,</hi> 2 Kings 20. For as we have already taken notice, it ſurpriſeth us in every Age, in every Time and Place, and in the midſt of all manner of Employments. Old <hi>Eli</hi> fell down backwards and broke his Neck, when he heard the unhappy news of the taking of the Ark, and the death of his Sons. <hi>Job</hi>'s Children dreamed of nothing but of ſolacing and delighting themſelves in their Feaſts and Jollity, when the Houſe, where they were, fell down, and buried them in the ruines. But beſides theſe unhappy accidents, how many are there whoſe mouth Death cloſeth on a ſuddain, without ſuffering them to ſpeak a word? How many are there in the World, who are thought to be in perfect health, and yet ſuddainly fall into an Apoplexy, and into other quick diſeaſes, ſo that they are ſeen to be ſooner dead, than thought to be ſick?</p>
            <pb n="196" facs="tcp:41646:102" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p>Beſides, when we ſhould have a greater ſtrength, and more vigor, ſo that we might foreſee the time of our departing, drawing near, Repentance, is not at our Command it is given to us from above, and a ſpecial favor of the Holy Spirit; God works not miracles every day, he changeth not, at every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Rocks into Springs of Water, nor Stones into Rivers of Oil; He grants not the favour to all Sinners hardened in their Luſts, and confirmed in their Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacy from him, to be converted, and to be waſh'd with the Tears of Repentance.</p>
            <p>If thou ſeeſt a Thief repenting at the time of his ſuffering; it is a particular example that doth not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boliſh the general Rule. By this Man God doth intend to comfort Sinners, who truly Repent at the end of their days, and to aſſure them that the Arms of his Mercy is always open to receive them into his favor. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, that true Repentance can never be too late, but I maintain that it can never be too ſoon; It is moſt certain that at every moment when the Sinner repents, God will ſhew him Mercy, but that moment is not in our power; for one ſinner that repents at the hour of death, there are thouſands that depart in impenitency. And to ſeek no other example, but that which Mount <hi>Calvary</hi> offers to us; If thou ſeeſt on one ſide of Chriſt a Thief converted, and believe, look on the other ſide, and thou ſhalt perceive a Wretch, who having lived in unrighteouſneſs and impiety, expires in his Sins, belching forth grievous Blaſphemies and Reproaches againſt the King of Glory: So that if one of theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable paſſages flatters thee, and lulls thy conſcience aſleep, the other ſhould move and awaken thee with an holy Fear. Moreover, the good Thief was convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the firſt moment, when Chriſt called and invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him; Therefore, now that you hear the voice of God calling, Harden not your hearts as in the day of provocation, for fear that God ſhould ſwear in his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:41646:102" rendition="simple:additions"/>that you ſhall never enter into his Reſt. Now, yea, at this very inſtant, that you read this, turn unto God with all your heart, and he will have pity and compaſſion upon you.</p>
            <p>When the opportunity is once loſt, it is not eaſily, and at all times, recover'd, therefore the Painters have repreſented Occaſion with a great Tuff of Hair on the Forehead, but all bald behind, unto every thing there is a ſeaſon; God hath vouchſafed unto us a time, and reſerved another for himſelf. Our time is when we are invited to Repentance, but God's time is when he manifeſts and declares his Juſtice and Judgements. During the ſpace of One hundred and twenty years, <hi>Noah,</hi> an Herald of Righteouſneſs preach'd Repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to the old World, this was their time; but when God's abuſed patience was juſtly provok'd, it turn'd into fury; then he ſent a fearful Deluge, that covered all the face of the Earth; This was God's time, and the day of his juſt Vengeance. When <hi>Lot</hi> ſpake to his Sons-in-law to perſwade them to go out of <hi>Sodem;</hi> this was the time of their Salvation and Deliverance; but when Fire and Brimſtone overwhelmed and burned them alive, their cries and gnaſhing of Teeth were as uſeleſs as their laughter and mocking had been formerly unjuſt. When <hi>Eſau</hi> ſold the priviledges of his Birth-right, it was the time of thinking ſeriouſly upon the true and heavenly Bleſſing, but when lie had ſold it for a ſup of Pottage, all his Tears and Weepings were as fruitleſs as his Gluttony had been unſatiable, and his Diſpoſition profane: When the Bridegroom in the <hi>Canticles,</hi> was at the door with the dew of his Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Joys, and the Myrrh of his Eternal Comforts; it was the Brides time, and the occaſion that was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferd to her, to enjoy the heavenly Delights; but when ſhe had delayed a while, unwilling to riſe from her Bed, and put on her Coat, he was gone, and it was to no purpoſe that ſhe ſought him about the City; for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:41646:103" rendition="simple:additions"/>of meeting with the embraces of her Beloved, ſhe finds her Enemies that beat and wound her. When the poor <hi>Lazarus</hi> did beg his Bread at the Rich man's Gate it was the time when this unmerciful Man ſhould have repented, and ſhewed Mercy to the Poor Man; but when he is in Hell, burning in the Flames, it is in vain that he lifts up his eyes to Heaven, to ſeek for ſome comfort. When our Saviour exhorted the Jews to believe in him, and that he wept ſo bitterly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> that had killed the Prophets; it was the time and opportunity of this unhappy Nation, it was the time of their Salvation, and of God's Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, but when they had obſtinately rejected this great God and Saviour, and deſired that his Bloud might be upon them and their Children, God hath caſt them away from him, and they are become a ſcorn and a reproach amongſt all the Nations of the Earth. Finally, as it is to no purpoſe, that a Malefactor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves to amend his life when the Judge is at the door, and when the Sergeants have caught him by the throat, or when he is upon the Gallows ready to be ſtrangled and executed; Likewiſe it is too late to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to think upon God, when Death ſeizeth us, and that Hell opens its jaws to ſwallow us. Miſerable wretch! Why deſpiſeſt thou the Riches of God's goodneſs and patience, and of his long ſuffering, not conſidering that the goodneſs of God invites thee to repentance; but by thine hardneſs of thine heart that is without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, thou treaſureſt up unto thy ſelf wrath againſt the day of wrath, and revelation of the Righteous judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, who ſhall render unto every man ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his Works? <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.</p>
            <p>Certainly our Salvation is a matter too important to be neglected, our Life too uncertain to delay it till the next day, and our Soul too precious to run the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of looſing it; if we had many, we might ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture the loſs of one, but ſeeing that we have but one
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:41646:103" rendition="simple:additions"/>only, and that if it be loſt, all the Riches and Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuries of the World cannot redeem it, we ſhould watch night and day to preſerve it; We ſhould be moved with an Holy fear of ſo great a loſs, and decline whatſoever might caſt this our precious Soul, into the ſecond Death, and Eternal damnation.</p>
            <p>It is our Lord and Saviour's Exhortation, <hi>Watch,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>for you know not the hour when your Lord is to come. Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation, for the Spirit is willing, but the fleſh is weak,</hi> Matt. 14. Mark 16. Luk 22. This advice was ſo neceſſary, that he doth often repeat it, <hi>Take heed to your ſelves, watch and pray, for you know not when that time ſhall be. Take heed to your ſelves leſt your hearts be overcharg'd with gluttony and drunkenneſs, and the cares of this life, and that day ſurprize you unawares, for as a ſnare it ſhall come on all them that dwell on the Face of the whole Earth. Watch ye therefore, and pray always, that ye may be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted worthy to eſcape all theſe things that ſhall come to paſs, and to ſtand before the Son of Man.</hi> Mat. 13. Luke 21.</p>
            <p>To awaken us the more from our Spiritual drowſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and profane ſleep, our Saviour brings the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the wicked Servant, who ſaid in his heart, <hi>My Lord delayeth his coming,</hi> Matt. 24. And therefore he began to beat his fellow ſervants, to eat drink, and be drunk; our Saviour adds, That the Lord of that ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant ſhall come in a day, when he looketh not for him, and in an hour that he is not expected, and ſhall cut him aſunder, and appoint him his portion with the hypocrites, there ſhall be weeping and gnaſhing of Teeth, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. The Parable of the fooliſh Virgins hath the ſame intent, they being fallen aſleep without any Oil in their Lamps, were ſo ſurpriz'd at the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grooms coming, that they could not be admitted into the Marriage Chamber; it was in vain that they did beat at the gate, with <hi>a Lord, Lord open unto us,</hi> Matt. 25. The door could not be open'd to them, but it was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:41646:104" rendition="simple:additions"/>from within, <hi>Verily I ſay unto you I know you not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I know that the chief and principal purpoſe of this and other Parables, is to teach us how we ſhould be prepar'd to expect the Glorious coming of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, but they may very well be applied unto Death; for it hath pleaſed God to keep ſecret and hidden the day, in the which he will call us to himſelf, and that of our Saviours coming to judgment, that we may be equally prepar'd, and diſpos'd for the one as well as for the other. As we ſhall be found at the time of our death, ſo ſhall we be judged at the great day when Chriſt ſhall come down from Heaven with the Angels of his Power, and from that judgement there ſhall be no Appeal. Let us therefore put off the Sin that doth ſo eaſily beſet us and break all the Chains of our filthy Luſts. Let us diſarm death, and take from it its venemous Darts, and its piercing ſtings. Let us pluck off the Claws, and the Teeth of this fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Beaſt, and extinguiſh all its fires, and it ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be able to terrify us Let us live the life of Saints, and God will give us grace to dye the death of the Righteous, and to end like unto them. Let us live as we would that we had lived at that inſtant when Death is upon our Lips. Let us live, as if at every moment we were to dy, and at every hour God did call unto us from his Heaven, Come and appear to Judgement.</p>
            <p>And when Satan, the World, and our own Fleſh ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licite and draw us to evil, let us ſay within our ſelves, Is it thus that thou wilt reward the Lord thy God, and acknowledge all the Bleſſings and Favors that thou haſt received from his bountiful hand?

Give me grace to eſteem it as that curſed Fire that hath kindled thy wrath, ſet the whole world in a flame, as that unfuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferable burden, under which Nature it ſelf ſighs and groans, and under which, Heaven it ſelf complains, as the murde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer of our firſt Parents, and of all Mankind in general; as the Executioner that crucified the Lord of Glory, and ſpilt his precious Bloud. In ſhort, give me grace to treat it as our moſt unreconcileable enemy that provoketh thy venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and that labors to caſt us headlong into the Abyſſe of Eternal Torments. O Father of Mercies, give me grace to perceive all the Beauties of Holineſs, and the Glory that ſhall reward it; that I may be enflamed with its love, and embrace it with all the affections of my Soul, that I may look upon it as the the off-ſpring of Heaven, as an image of thy beautiful Face, and as a beam of thy Glory; as the rich Jewel which the Devil had taken from us, as the higheſt perfection repreſented by thy Son Jeſus Chriſt; and as the chief part of that felicity unto which we pretend, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which thou wilt bring us in thine heavenly Paradiſe. O God of my Salvation, how bitter are the fruits of ſin? thou ſeeſt my diſpleaſure, for having yielded ſo long to that loathſome Tyrant, and aſſiſted my carnal Luſts that war a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Soul. Thou ſeeſt the inward grief of my mind, for having neglected to employ that life which I have received from thy Mercy and Goodneſs, that I might live to fear, ſerve, and obey thy Sacred and Divine Commands; What ſhall I ſay, O Soveraign Lord of the World? I have ſinned againſt thee, againſt thee have I ſinned, and done that which is abominable in thy ſight, but I repent in Duſt and Aſhes, my ſins appear before me day and night, I conſider them with horror. Alas O Lord, before whom all things are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and open, thou knoweſt that my greateſt grief proceeds from my not grieving enough, and that my moſt ſenſible af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction is of not being afflicted ſufficiently, becauſe I cannot feel a Repentance anſwerable to the greatneſs and number of mine offences. O God that ſearcheth the Heart and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:41646:106" rendition="simple:additions"/>all things, thou underſtandeſt the greatneſs of my crimes, and what ſhould be my ſorrow for their Commiſſion; thou deſireſt not the death of a ſinner, but rather that he ſhould turn and live; Turn me, O Lord, and then I ſhall be turned. Almighty God, who fetcheſt Water out of the hardeſt Rocks, draw out of my ſtony Heart the tears of ſincere Repentance, which might he acceptable unto thee? Break and mollify this hard heart, that it may receive the Waters of Eternal life, but rather pluck out this wicked heart, and give me a new heart, faſhioned with thine own hands, an heart where thy Glorious Image, with all its moſt beautiful fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, may appear with the moſt ſacred beams that proceed from thy Divine Face, an heart that may be enflam'd with an Holy Zeal for thy Glory, and burn with a love for thee. O God of all goodneſs, who haſt not ſpared the bloud of thine only Son, to blot out the ſentence of my doom, grant me thine Holy Spirit, that may ſanctify me, and make me a new creature, that I may bear the marks and the Livery of thy choſen, and that I may ſhine in the World as a Lamp that burns with an Heavenly Fire. Crucify this mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable fleſh with all its Luſts, that I may live, not I, but that Chriſt may live in me, that from henceforth I may live in the faith of the Son of God, who hath loved me, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven himſelf for me, that he might redeem and cleanſe me from all iniquity; Animate my Soul, enlighten mine underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, direct and govern the actions of my life; take poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of me, and rule me in ſuch a manner, that all mine affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, words and thoughts, may be ſanctified by thy Grace, and tend to the promotion of thy Glory. That I may not only abhor all ſuch things as are diſpleaſing to thee, but that I may alſo ſhun thoſe, which I know not whether they will be acceptable to thee; that I may not only abominate the filthy vices, but alſo hate the Garments infected with ſin, and that I may abſtain from all appearance of evil, If the Devil, the World, and mine own fleſh tempt and ſtir me up to any ſin, let the dread of thy Divine Majeſty ſeize upon my Soul: let Death enter into my mind, and fill me with
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:41646:106" rendition="simple:additions"/>ſuch an holy fear, as may ſtop and hinder me, Give me grace to conſider, that I ſhould be the moſt miſerable of all Creatures, if I did dye in offending and ſinning againſt thee; if I were buried with my crimes. Let me always think upon</hi> St. John<hi>'s ſaying,</hi> Bleſſed and Holy is he, who hath part in the firſt Reſurrection, the ſecond death ſhall have no dominion over him. <hi>Seeing that thy ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving grace unto all men, hath appeared ſo openly unto me; Grant that renouncing all impiety, and worldly Luſts, I may live ſoberly, juſtly, and religiouſly in this preſent life, that I may apply my thoughts to all thoſe things that are True, Honourable, Juſt, Pure, Lovely, of good Renown, and generally to all things that are vertuous and worthy of praiſe. More eſpecially, grant O good God, that I may be poſſeſſed with a violent Charity, which may carry me to actions of Love and Mercy, for thou delighteſt in ſuch Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices. Charity covers a multitude of ſins. O merciful Lord, the task which thou haſt given me, is long and tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, my life is but ſhort, and I know not how ſoon thou wilt come to knock at the door of mine houſe. O God, whoſe Mercies are for ever, performe in me, that which thou doſt command, and then command what thou wilt produce in me with power, both the Will and the Deed, according to thy good pleaſure. Give me grace to employ myſelf in thy work with Diligence, Faithfulneſs, and Zeal, that I may not be troubled at thy Glorious coming. Give me the Lamp of thy Sanctuary, lighted at the beams of the Sun of Righteouſneſs. Fill my Soul with the precious and Divine Oil that runs from thy Spirit; and cloath me with the Robes of Holineſs and Light, that I may be ready to follow the Bridegroom into the Banqueting Chamber, and ſit at thy Table with the holy Patriarchs, Prophets, Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, Martyrs, and the Holy Virgin, and with all thoſe who have waſh'd, and whitened their Robes in the Bloud of the Lamb. Let me live the life of the Saints, that I may dye the death of the Righteous, that I may be admitted into thy Glorious Reſt with thy Choſen; and that when I am
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:41646:107" rendition="simple:additions"/>breathing forth thy laſt gasp, thy Son Jeſus Chriſt may call to me from Heaven,</hi> Come good and faithful Servant, enter into the joy of thy Lord, <hi>Amen.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>The ſixth Remedy againſt the fears of Death, is to repoſe our ſelves upon God's good Providence.</hi>
               </p>
            </argument>
            <p>SOme perſons there are ſo brutiſh and ſtupified, that they never think upon the great end and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne of their Creation; they are not able to give a juſt account wherefore God hath put them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the World, they are Carnal and Earthly minds, who imagine that they were created for themſelves, as brute Beaſts, onely to eat and drink. Such are of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of thoſe that are mentioned by <hi>St. Paul,</hi> their God is their Belly, and their end is Eternal Miſery. But there are alſo ſome wiſe and vertuous minds, that are continually meditating upon the favors that they received from Heaven, which they employ to their right and proper end. Such Celeſtial under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings being enlightned from above, conſider very well that they are not born for themſelves, but for their Countrey, for their Parents, for their Friends, and chiefly for to ſerve God and his Church on Earth; therefore they deſire to live only to glorify their Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, and advance his Kingdom.</p>
            <p>When this good deſire is well governed, it is as ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to God, as a ſweet ſmelling Sacrifice. This was <hi>David</hi>'s earneſt deſire in the 119 <hi>Pſalm. Let my Soul live, that it may praiſe thee.</hi> This Holy Zeal for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced ſo many bitter Tears from King <hi>Hezekiah</hi> in his ſickneſs, and cauſed him to intreat moſt earneſtly to
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:41646:107" rendition="simple:additions"/>live yet longer in the World. This Wiſe and Religious Prince did well foreſee the fearful Evils, the grievous Confuſion, and the abominable Idolatry that was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſucceed after his Death, in the Kingdom of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea.</hi> He was therefore very deſirous to glorify God on Earth, and to accompliſh the Reformation which he had begun; He deſired to have Children whom he might teach to fear God with all their heart, and to ſerve him according to his Holy and Divine Will, that he might cauſe Piety to continue in his Houſe and Royal Family; he diſcovers this Holy deſire in his Divine Hymn, which he ſung unto God, after his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous recovery. <hi>Behold, for Peace I had great bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but thou haſt in love to my Soul delivered it from the pit of corruption, for thou haſt caſt all my ſins behind thy back, for the Grave cannot praiſe thee,</hi> Iſ. 38. <hi>Death cannot ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrate thee, they that go down into the pit, cannot hope for thy Truth, the living he ſhall praiſe thee, as I do this day, the Father to the Children ſhall make known thy Truth: The Lord was ready to ſave me, therefore we will ſing my Songs to the ſtringed Inſtruments, all the days of our life in the houſe of the Lord.</hi> We find the ſame ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt deſire in <hi>St. Paul,</hi> for when he looks upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and upon the miſeries that attend upon him on Earth, and lifts up his Eyes to ſee the Heavenly Bliſs that waits for him above, he deſires to depart out of this earthly Tabernacle, and to be with Chriſt, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth that it would be his great advantage; but when he looks upon the Church of Chriſt, his deſire of the Salvation, and inſtruction of his Brethren, cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth him to prefer their Comfort to his own Happineſs and Joy. <hi>It is,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>more expedient for you that I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in the Fleſh, and I know for certain, that I ſhall abide and remain with you for your advantage, and the joy of your faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This deſire of Life, with an intent of Glorifying God, is Good and Holy, but it is no eaſy task to keep
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:41646:108"/>it within its juſt and lawful bounds, for very often it becomes vicious, when it is ſtirr'd up by a fond love of our own perſons, which makes us ſo loth to dye.</p>
            <p>For example, when a great Prince, animated with an Heroical Vertue, is engaged in a War for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of his Subjects, and for the delivery of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny afflicted People, from oppreſſion and Tyranny, if God bleſſeth his Armies, and cauſeth his Glorious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes to ſucceed, he will not be well pleaſed, if Death at that inſtant offers to croſs him, to break in pieces his victorious Arm, to put an end to his Conqueſts, and to caſt his Crown to the ground, he may juſtly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain in this manner, Muſt I now leave off ſuch a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and a brave Deſigne? muſt I here ſtop in the midſt of ſuch a glorious Race? and muſt Death bury with my Body, the expectations of ſo many good Men? I am afraid that all my labors will vaniſh away with my breath; I have juſt cauſe to fear, that my fall will draw after me the deſtruction of many poor People that depend upon me. I fear that oppreſſion and Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny will reſume freſh Spirits, and a greater Bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and prove, for the future, more grievous and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fufferable. O cruel and inhumane Death! by taking away my Life, thou bringeſt my Friends to Execution, and the Arrows that thou ſtickeſt in my Heart, do pierce the Souls of many innocent People.</p>
            <p>Likewiſe, he that is promoted to be the King's Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerent in a Province, or to be a Governor of a rich Countrey, and an important Place, may be grieved becauſe Death ſnatcheth him away in the middle of all his buſineſs, eſpecially if it be in troubleſome times, and if he ſees none of a ſufficient ability to ſucceed him; Muſt I, will ſuch an one ſay? Muſt I quit ſo ſoon this Glorious employment? Muſt I ſo quickly leave my Prince's ſervice, and forſake ſo many poor People, as a Flock without a Shepheard? Death, how hateful and
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:41646:108" rendition="simple:additions"/>odious art thou? Thou delighteſt to bring all things into confuſion and trouble.</p>
            <p>Thus a brave General of a victorious Army, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing full of Courage, manageth a ſucceſsful War, for the Honor of his Prince, and the advantage of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, cannot but complain againſt Death, when it comes to ſubdue him before he hath totally ſubdued and overcome his Enemies, eſpecially, if the times be ſo unhappy, that none is able to undertake that employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment after him; he will be ready to break forth into complaints: Muſt I leave off ſo many Glorious deſigns? Muſt I forſake my moſt faithful Soldiers, and aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don them to the mercy of their Enemies, or to the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pricious humour of an unexperienced Succeſſor? O Death, full of envy! wilt thou pluck out of my hands, ſo ſoon, this conquering Sword, and cut off, with one blow of thy Sithe, ſo many great expectations? In the ſame manner, he that ſits in the moſt Honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſeats of Judicature, as a Judge, a Preſident, or a Counſellor, or any other chief Magiſtrate, will doubtleſs mourn if Death ſeizeth upon him in the flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of his age; eſpecially, if he fears, that after him corrupt Men will ſucceed, who may be likened to whitened Walls. Muſt I, will he ſay, leave ſo ſoon this noble Office, in which I took ſo much delight? O inconſiderate Death, why doſt thou not ſuffer me to wear my Purple, until ſuch time as I ſhall be weary to bear it? Why doſt thou not permit me to ſit here upon this magnificent Seat, until I tumble off with old Age?</p>
            <p>Likewiſe a faithful Miniſter of the Gospel, when he perceives the work of the Lord to proſper in his hands; Satan falls from Heaven by his means, as a Lightning, and <hi>Dagon</hi> to be brought upon his Face to the ground, may juſtly wonder at Death's approaches, and ſpeak in this manner; Muſt I ſo ſoon quit the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of this Holy Function, in which I took my great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:41646:109" rendition="simple:additions"/>delight? Muſt I break off from this Sacred Work, by which I did advance ſo happily, the Glory of God; I am afraid, that when I am gone, ravening Wolves will enter into the Lord's Flock, and a terrible night of ignorance will involve our poſterity.</p>
            <p>Thus a Father of a Family, who paſſionately loves his Wife and Children, ſhall never ſee death, but ſhall feel all his Bowels move, and his Heart tormented with grief he will ſigh out ſuch expreſſions as theſe. Muſt I forſake a poor forlorn Wife, ſwimming in Tears? Muſt I leave my tender-hearted Parents, who found my life a comfort, and will find my Death an afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? Muſt I abandon my dear Children whom I love as my Soul, without guide, and in danger of looſing the ſmall temporal means that I have provided for them; in danger alſo of being overcome by the vicious cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms of the age, and inticed to Idolatry and Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition.</p>
            <p>That we may be able to govern this violent paſſion that prevails ſo much upon our minds, we muſt la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor betimes to bring our ſelves to this; <hi>That we may reſt upon the good Providence of our Heavenly Father.</hi> Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Souls, meditate upon this excellent ſaying, in the 37 <hi>Pſalm, Leave thy ways to the Lord, and truſt in him, and he will direct thee.</hi> And in the 59 <hi>Pſal. Caſt thy burden upon the Lord, and he will ſuſtain thee.</hi> For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get not alſo that bleſſed exhortation of <hi>St. Peter, Caſt all your cares upon God, for he careth for you.</hi> Imprint al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in your minds, <hi>St. Paul's</hi> aſſertion, <hi>All things work together for good to them that love God.</hi> Remember the noble reſolution of this great Apoſtle, <hi>According to my earneſt expectation, and my hope, that in nothing I ſhall be aſhamed, but that with all boldneſs as always, ſo now alſo Chriſt ſhall be magnified in my Body, whether it be by life or by death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thou deſireſt to be inſtrumental in the ſervice of God, and of the Publick; it is an excellent deſire in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:41646:109" rendition="simple:additions"/>and praiſe worthy, but it belongs to God to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point the ſervice that he intends to receive from thee; it belongs to him to preſcribe unto thee thy task, and to order thy bounds: he knows when he is to releaſe thee from thy labor, and how long thou muſt fight. Is thine eye evil becauſe thy God is ſo good and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious as to ſhorten thy work and troubles? All ſuch as follow chearfully the Banners of the God of Hoſts, and never retreat without the Command of the great Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral of Heaven and Earth, ſhall enjoy a bleſſed victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and obtain the honor of the Triumph; as well the Novice and the freſh Soldier, as the old and long expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced. All ſuch as labor faithfully in the Lord's Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard, ſhall receive, from him, an eternal Reward, as well he that continues but an hour, as the other that bear the heat and burden of the day. When thou ſhouldeſt have gone but a few ſteps in the paths of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, thy God is ſo noble and liberal, that he will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow upon thee an uncorruptible Crown of Glory, as well as if thou hadſt continued there many years.</p>
            <p>Great Princes, that yield unto the King of Kings, a Religious Reſpect, and that ſeek your greateſt Glory in the Croſs of Chriſt, ſubmit your ſelves altogether to the pleaſure of your univerſal Monarch; for ſeeing the Lives of all Men are governed by his wiſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, he hath a particular regard, and an high eſteem of the Lives of Kings and Princes, the Sons of his right hand. Therefore whilſt it is expedient for his Glory and their Salvation, that they ſhould live upon Earth, he placeth round about their Sacred Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons his Holy Angels, and encompaſſeth them with a wall of Fire. Remember, that as ſoon as the King of <hi>Iſrael</hi> was ſeated upon the Throne, God commanded him to take in hand the Book of his Law, and to read in it all the days of his life. Ask from him that Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Prudence that is requiſite to govern ſuch multitudes of People, and beſeech him to grant unto
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:41646:110" rendition="simple:additions"/>you the ſtrength and virtue that is neceſſary to bear ſo great a burden. Let the Sword that he hath intruſted in your hands, be to do juſtice upon Offenders, and to protect the Guiltleſs. As you are living Images of God's Soveraign Authority over his Creatures; Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that you ſhould alſo repreſent his Goodneſs and Mercy: follow the example of him who reſiſts the Proud, but gives grace to the Humble. Live in ſuch a manner, that your Subjects may cheriſh and honor you, as their common Father, may obey and ſerve you as their Lord, and may reſpect and fear you as their King. Suffer not your Heart to be puft up with pride, when you behold the large Dominions that God hath put under your Command, and the People that own you for their Soveraign; But lift up your eyes to the ſpacious Heavens, take a view of their vaſt Extent, and ſee how the whole Earth is inconſiderable in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of them, and think upon God, before whom all Nations are but as the ſmalleſt duſt of a Ballance, and as a few drops of Water. Conſider well, that your Subjects are Creatures that God hath made after his own likeneſs, and redeemed by the death of his Son, and that they are to Reign with you for ever in Heaven. Remember that the more God hath committed to your Truſt, the greater muſt be your reckoning, and that you muſt one day appear in perſon before his dreadful Throne, without Scepter or Crown, as ſo many wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Sinners to implore his Mercy. Search into your ſelves, and examine what you are; your Bodies are ſubject to wounds, infirmities, and diſeaſes, as that of the meaneſt of your ſervants; Your Souls alſo are mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved with the ſame Paſſions and Luſts as theirs. In ſhort, you are entered into the World in the ſame manner, as the moſt miſerable Slave, and you ſhall go out of it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain as he doth; ſo that if a crowd of flatterers ſooth you up as they did <hi>Herod, A voice of God and not of Man,</hi> Acts 12. Mind well what God ſpeaks to you from
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:41646:110" rendition="simple:additions"/>Heaven, <hi>I have ſaid that ye are Gods, and the Children of the moſt high, nevertheleſs you ſhall dye as Men, and you that are the chiefeſt, ſhall fall as the reſt,</hi> Pſal. 72. During the time of your abode in the World, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy your Blood, Sweat, and all the Strength and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er that God hath put into your hands, for the good and advantage of your States, and for the defence and preſervation of the people, that ſhelter themſelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der your wings. And if, in the midſt of your greateſt and moſt flouriſhing Proſperities, Death comes to give you a ſummons to depart; let fall the Scepter willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to joyn your hands together, and to fall down and adore the King of the whole Earth. Grieve not for the loſs of worldly Glory that paſſeth away as a Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, or as a ſhadow, for God promiſeth another, that ſhall be more laſting than the light of the Sun. If you can but overcome Death and your ſelves, God will cauſe you to ſit down upon another Throne, and will beſtow upon you a Kingdom that ſhall never be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, <hi>Revel.</hi> 3. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.</p>
            <p>Wiſe and Religious Princes, be not ſolicitous for the things that ſhall happen after your deceaſe. He by whom Kings Reign, and Princes do Juſtice, is able e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to enrich your Succeſſor with the Graces and Qualities that become a powerful Prince. It may be that he will beſtow upon him more Glory and Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs than upon you. When King <hi>David</hi> had ended his mortal Race, God took him into his Reſt; it ſeems at firſt, that the loſs of ſo good a Prince could not be repaired; but God cauſed <hi>Solomon</hi> to ſit upon his Fathers Throne, and made him the wiſeſt and the moſt happy Monarch of the World. <hi>David</hi> did but remove God's Ark, but <hi>Solomon</hi> built, for him, a ſtate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and magnificent Temple; <hi>David</hi> was a Type of the Encounters and Victories of the Son of God, but <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> repreſented his Glorious Triumphs, and that
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:41646:111" rendition="simple:additions"/>Eternal Peace, with which he ſhall bleſs his Choſen in the Kingdom of Heaven.</p>
            <p>What if you leave your Children under age, be not diſcouraged, for God will preſerve them, as the Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net upon his Right Hand, or as the Apple of his Eye. Think upon <hi>Joſias,</hi> who was but eight years old when he ſucceeded in the Kingdom of <hi>Judea;</hi> neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs there was never a Prince more Holy and more Religious, none ever did more good to the Church of God; and that you may be able to ſtrengthen your Faith, and confirm your glorious expectations, medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate upon the Life of <hi>Joas,</hi> who was but a year old when his Father was killed, and an infernal fury ſought to deſtroy him, but in the middle of ſo many Trage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. God preſerved him alive, by a Miracle, and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced him, in a Glorious manner, upon the Throne of his Fathers. Seeing therefore that it is the pleaſure of him who gives and takes away the earthly Crowns, leave cheerfully this corruptible one, to receive another that is immortal and uncorruptible. You alſo, noble Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors of Countreys, and Caſtles, that repreſent the Perſons of your Kings and Princes; remember that this Dignity comes not only from the appointment of your Maſters, but from God himſelf, who holds in his hands the Hearts of all the Kings and Princes of the world. Remember what our Saviour told the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of <hi>Judea, Thou ſhouldeſt have no power upon me, if it were not given to thee from above,</hi> John 19. Let all the world ſee, by you, that there is nothing more conſonant and to your ſuitable than Piety towards God, with faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs Prince. Take heed that you abuſe not your Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and Authority in ſatisfying your paſſions, and pleaſing your covetouſnes or vanity. Protect not the guilty, and oppreſs not the innocent. Seeing that you are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to puniſh evil doers, and to encourage ſuch as do well, behave your ſelves as if ye were always in the ſight of your Prince, or rather behave your ſelves, as
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:41646:111" rendition="simple:additions"/>in the preſence, and in the ſight of God, before whom all things are naked and open, as if you were to give up unto him, an account of your Stewardſhip. Whilſt you are happily employed in the ſervice of your Prince, and of your Countrey; if Death comes to interrupt your proſperity, yield your ſelves, without reſiſtance, to the wiſe Governance and Orders of him, who is both your Soveraign Lord, and unto whom you muſt be ſubject on Earth.</p>
            <p>Trouble not your ſelves with the thoughts of the things that ſhall happen after your death, and think not but that there are yet ſome worthy and able to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed you in your employments. When God is pleas'd to be favourable to Kings, and to cauſe their Seats to flouriſh, he raiſeth up faithful Miniſters, and wiſe Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors, as when he gave to <hi>Pharaoh</hi> a <hi>Joſeph;</hi> to <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zekiah,</hi> an <hi>Eliakim;</hi> to <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> a <hi>Daniel.</hi> When he pleaſeth to ſearch into his unfathomed Treaſuries, he can quickly provide Men after his own Heart adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with all the abilities required for a worthy diſcharge of a glorious employment. In the mean while, if thou haſt overcome Satan, Sin, the World, and Death, thou ſhalt go and take poſſeſſion of a greater, and more laſting Glory. He that bears upon his Garments and Thighs, this Inſcription! <hi>The King of Kings, and the Lord of Lords,</hi> hath given out this unchangeable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe; he that ſhall overcome, and hath kept my Works until the end, I will give unto him power over the Nations, and he ſhall govern them with a Rod of Iron.</p>
            <p>Right Honourable Counſellors, that aſſiſt your Prince with your wiſe Counſels; and you inferior Magiſtrates and Judges, never forget what <hi>Jehoſaphat</hi> ſaid to the Judges of his Kingdom, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 9. <hi>Take heed what ye do, for ye judge not for Man, but for the Lord, who is with you in the judgement. Wherefore now let the fear of the Lord be upon you, take heed and do it, for there is no
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:41646:112" rendition="simple:additions"/>iniquity with the Lord our God, nor reſpect of perſons, nor ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of Gifts.</hi> Pſal. 85. Whenſoever you go to take your place amongſt the Judges of the Kingdom; remember that God ſits there upon his Throne, and every time that you give a Charge, or pronounce a Sentence, conſider that you are to follow God's directions, and that this Great Creator takes notice of your Actions, Words, and of the motions of your Heart, and that he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands your moſt ſecret thoughts, Judge with the ſame equity and juſtice, with which you deſire to be judged: If you be tempted to do Wrong, to conceal the Truth, or to commit an injuſtice, either by a baſe compliance, or by an expectation of Worldly advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, or for filthy Lucre; remember that it is the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil that tempts you, pray therefore to God to deliver you from his power; and that you may be better able to command your ſelves with an Holy dread, think upon death that warns you in perſon, nay, drags you to appear before the Univerſal Judge of Mankind, to give up an account of all your Actions, and of the Sentences that you have given; but if Death ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeth you when you are diſcharging your Offices with all the diligence and integrity imaginable; ſtay not till it forces you, but caſt off willingly the Robes of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicature, to take the Habit of a Supplicant, and pray to God, that he may not enter into judgement with you, becauſe no living creature ſhall be juſtified in his preſence, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 13.</p>
            <p>Let not the conſideration of the paſſages that ſhall happen after your deceaſe, obſtruct your Chriſtian re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution. There are men enough in the World of a ſufficient ability, to ſupply your places; And God is able to raiſe up ſome that we dream not of, as when he created in one day threeſcore and ten Judges in <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> whom he endowed with ſufficient abilities, and with the graces of his Holy Spirit; He may produce ſome that will be as Righteous and Juſt as your ſelves,
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:41646:112" rendition="simple:additions"/>and, it may, be more enlightened with diſcretion, and prudence, than you. Come off therefore willingly from theſe ſeats of Judicature, ſo beſet with Thorns, upon which you ſhould never reſt without horror and dread, if you ſincerely fear God, and go with confidence to the Throne of Grace, that you may obtain Mercy, and find Grace to help in time of need, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.</p>
            <p>And as true Piety is aſſoon to be found in the Tents of <hi>David,</hi> as in the Temple of <hi>Solomon;</hi> as the Sword of <hi>Gideon</hi> agrees well with that of the God of Hoſts, I may make my addreſſes to you, worthy Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals, brave Captains, and generous Nobility, unto whom Kings, Princes, and Commonwealths commit the leading of their Armies; I ſpeak not unto you prophane Atheiſts, that laugh at the moſt Holy things, and that are of opinion, that all fear of God muſt be baniſhed out of your Troops and Companies, and that the moſt wretched Varlets are the beſt Soldiers; but I ſpeak to you Chriſtian and Religious Commanders, who forget not, by your promotion amongſt Men, that you are nevertheleſs the Soldiers of Jeſus Chriſt; and although you wear at your ſide a material Sword, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get not to employ alſo the ſword of the Spirit, the word of God that dwels in your hearts: Neither do I intend to ſpeak to you who manage War, with an intent only to ſatisfy your Revenge, your Ambition, or your Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs; but I ſpeak to you brave and worthy Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, who have purified your weapons in an Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Fire, who undertake War, only to procure a more laſting Peace to the publick, and who fight only to ſerve your Prince and Countrey; you that are the great bulwarks of States and Empires, by whoſe la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors and watchings Men ſleep in ſecurity; Let the whole World ſee by experience in your perſons, that there is nothing that agrees better with true genero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity than Piety and the fear of God; behave your ſelves always, as in the ſight of your Maker, who is
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:41646:113" rendition="simple:additions"/>at your Elbows, and accompanies you in all your acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Remember that he commanded to remove all filth from the Camp of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> becauſe of his Holy and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Preſence. If you will obtain his Bleſſing upon your perſons and deſignes, caſt out of your Armies the filth of Vice, and Puniſh, without Mercy, the Rapes, Burnings, all Impiety and Blaſphemies; make your Soldiers put in practice <hi>St. John</hi> the Baptiſt's moſt excellent advice to the Soldiers of his time, who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired what they were to do to be be ſaved; <hi>Do vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>to no man, neither accuſe any falſly, and be content with your wages.</hi> Live as Lambs, and fight as Lions, Spare as much as you can the bloud of your Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, and ſhed not that of your Enemies, but againſt your Wills, becauſe they are God's Creatures, and Men that bear his Image. Never truſt to your own valor and experience, but remember that it is God who gives Courage, and ſtrengthens the hands in the day of Battel, who cauſeth Fear and Terror to fly whither he liſteth. Look always upon <hi>David</hi>'s example. There was never a Captain more couragious, nor more willing to venture his life; and yet there was never a perſon more zealous in Prayer to God, nor more ſubmiſſive to his Will, nor more careful to return unto him, the praiſe of all his advantages: and if Death comes to put a ſtop to your victories, or to call you away in a trice, in which your Prudence and Courage is requiſite, won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der not at it, conſider that God offers you by this means an occaſion of a more Glorious Victory, and of a more Magnificent Triumph; for the victory over thouſands of Mortal Men, and of the whole World, is nothing in compariſon of a victory over Death and Hell. Inquire not who ſhall ſucceed you in the Conduct of your Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, out of a diſtruſt of God's good providence; for he who is able to raiſe up Children unto <hi>Abraham,</hi> out of Stones, can raiſe up alſo, from thence, Captains and Soldiers when he pleaſeth, to give a check to the
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:41646:113" rendition="simple:additions"/>Enemies pride, and to deliver his People from their hands; he can make <hi>Gideons, Jephtha</hi>'s, <hi>Sampſons,</hi> and ſuch like extraordinary Commanders; Who knows but that he will cauſe a General to ſucceed you, that ſhall have more Courage and Generoſity, and that ſhall be bleſſed with a greater Happineſs, and more Glorious Succeſſes? When <hi>Moſes</hi> departed to his Reſt, <hi>Joſhua</hi> Commanded in his ſtead, and for that purpoſe God enabled him with a noble Spirit of Wiſdom and Courage; for one Enemy that <hi>Moſes</hi> overcame, <hi>Joſhua</hi> deſtroyed thouſands; whereas <hi>Moſes</hi> did but coaſt along the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and turn up and down in the Wilderneſs, <hi>Joſhua</hi> brought the People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> into that pleaſant Countrey, and into a peaceable poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it. Seeing therefore that it is God's pleaſure, leave to others the care of worldly Wars, and ye go to gather the pleaſant and delicious Fruits of an Eternal Peace, which hath been purchaſed unto you by the Bloud of Chriſt,</p>
            <p>Likewiſe ye faithful Miniſters of Jeſus Chriſt; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member to ſhew the example of a reſignation to God's good pleaſure, according to your Doctrine; Let not Death cauſe you to draw back: thou haſt, my Brother, a Will, to Glorify God on Earth, well, but thou ſhalt Glorify him better in Heaven, with more zeal and leſs hindrance; whilſt thou art ſurrounded and fetter'd with theſe Fetters of Mortality, thy Miniſtry muſt needs be accompanied with many imperfections. Thou imagineſt, that if it pleaſed God to prolong thy days, thou mayeſt be inſtrumental in the reformation of the World; but thou art miſtaken, <hi>My Brother,</hi> for this World is accuſtom'd to Evil, and this Age is harden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Iniquity. Preach as much as thou wilt to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of this inferior World, it ſhall be as in the times of <hi>Noah,</hi> the Herald of Righteouſneſs, when the patience of God waited for the converſion of Sinners, for the whole Earth hath corrupted its ways, ſo that
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:41646:114" rendition="simple:additions"/>all the thoughts and imaginations of the Heart of Man are evil continually, from his Cradle they are cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt and filthy; And if God doth not interpoſe his Almighty Hand, and declare in us the Virtue of his Holy Spirit, our thoughts will grow worſe and worſe, until we tumble into our Graves. If thou afflict never ſo much thy juſt and innocent Soul, and ſpend thy ſelf in exhorting the greateſt Sinners, to fly from the wrath to come, and the judgements of God that hang over their guilty Heads; it may be thou ſhalt be mock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by thy neareſt Relations, as <hi>Lot</hi> was by his Sons-in-law. When thou wouldeſt thunder out the threatenings of God's Law againſt the abominations of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> as the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> did once, thou ſhouldeſt be forced at laſt to confeſs, <hi>I have labour'd in vain, I have employed my ſtrength for nought,</hi> Iſai. 49. Jer. 6. When thine Eyes ſhould be converted into a freſh Spring of Tears, and when thou ſhouldeſt ſpend the days and the nights in cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling upon the Superſtitious, the Schiſmaticks, and Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters, to forſake their falſe worſhip, and their unchriſtian proceedings; thou ſhalt not be able to ſoften the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their Hearts, nor overcome their obſtinacy, but they will be ready to ſpeak to thee in the Jews language to <hi>Jeremiah. As for the word that thou haſt ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to us in the name of the Lord, we will not hearken unto thee, but we will certainly do whatſoever thing goeth forth out of our own mouths, to burn incenſe unto the Queen of Heaven, and to pour out Drink-offerings unto her, as we have done, we and our Fathers, our Kings, and our Princes, in the Cities of Judah, and in the ſtreets of Jeruſalem, for then had we plenty of Victuals, and were well, and ſaw no evil,</hi> Jer. 44. When thou ſhouldeſt ſpeak with a Divine Tongue, and with an Heavenly Wiſdom, thou mayeſt have good cauſe to cry out, <hi>Who hath believed our report? and to whom hath the arm of the Lord been revealed?</hi> Iſai. 5. John 12. In ſhort, as the Rivers of freſh Water that run continually into the
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:41646:114" rendition="simple:additions"/>Sea, derive not from thence their natural bitterneſs; thus thy good and Holy Life, thy Learned and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Sermons will not be able to remove the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions of this preſent evil Age, nor ſtop the Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, and hinder the overflowings of Vice, for thy la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor and induſtry, if compared with the corruption of the World, are as unconſiderable as a few drops of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in compariſon of the Ocean. This curſed Earth may be watered with thy Sweat and Tears; it will nevertheleſs bring forth nothing but Bryars and Thiſtles; the Weeds which thou thinkeſt to pluck up, will tear thy Skin, and draw bloud out of thy Hands, In ſhort, he that plants is nothing, nor he that watereth, but it is God who giveth the increaſe, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.</p>
            <p>It is juſtly to be feared, that in ſtaying any longer time in this corrupt and unwholſome Air; thou mayeſt receive ſome evil impreſſions from the general contagion. It is to be feared, that thou mayeſt ſully thy pure Hands, by handling ſo many Wounds and Sores, and that the Thorns of this curſed Earth, may pluck off the Wooll of thine harmleſs and innocent life.</p>
            <p>But when thou ſhouldeſt have a thouſand times more Gifts and Graces, and that thy labors ſhould bring far greater advantages and profit to Chriſt's Church; it belongs not to thee to give Laws unto thy God, but to follow the motion of his Will. Leave to him the chief care of his own Houſhold, and reſt upon his Eternal Providence; He hath more right in the Church than thou canſt pretend to, for he hath cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated it by his Power, and redeem'd it by his precious Bloud. He that cares not for his own, eſpecially for thoſe of his Family, hath denied the Faith, and is worſe than an Infidel; and can God, who is Faithfulneſs it ſelf, and the very Being of Truth; God, who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not deny himſelf, and whoſe Gifts and Calling are without Repentance, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. Can ſuch a God caſt off
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:41646:115" rendition="simple:additions"/>all care of his Church, of that Church which he em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braceth with an Eternal Love, and cheriſheth as the apple of his Eye? <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. This Father of Mercies, who hath not ſpared his own Son, but hath delivered him to dye for his Church, how ſhould not he with him freely give her all things? <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. He underſtands bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than thou, and all the men of the World, what is proper and advantageous for this Holy Congregation, and for every member that compoſes it. He knows how to provide for all its wants, for his Wiſdom is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, and his Providence is moſt wonderful.</p>
            <p>When this great God hath a deſigne to plague his Enemies, and to declare his juſtice, he hath always fit Agents ready, and his Quiver full of Arrows; As ſoon as he commands the Holy Angels that wait before him, to caſt their Sicles into the Earth, and to reap or pour down the Viols of his wrath; theſe Holy Spirits fly with an unſpeakable ſwiftneſs to perform his Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Pleaſure, <hi>Revel,</hi> 14, &amp; 16. Likewiſe when he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to do good to his Choſen, he finds in every place the Heralds of his Mercy, and his Divine hand is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways full of Bleſſings. As the Main Ocean of his won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Riches can never become dry; Likewiſe the Channels by which he conveys them to us, ſhall never fail.</p>
            <p>The cauſe of thy complaints ſhould ſerve to appeaſe thy Grief, nouriſh thy Faith, and increaſe thy Hopes, for if thou art graced with extraordinary Gifts, this proceeds neither from thy Nature, nor thine Induſtry, but God's Favour and Bounty. Now thou mayeſt be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured that his hand is not ſhortened, his great Power is not leſſened, the Well-ſpring of all his Bleſſings and Wonders, is not ſtopt nor dryed up. <hi>Iſ.</hi> 49. He that ſends a deſired whiteneſs, the prognoſtick of an approaching harveſt to the ſpacious Fields, <hi>John</hi> 4. He ſends alſo, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Spiritual Harveſt, Laborers when he ſees it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient. In this latter Age, and in this decay of the
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:41646:115" rendition="simple:additions"/>World, as well as in the firſt appearance of his Church, <hi>Luk</hi> 10. he finds Men to work in his Vineyard, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he forms and faſhions them with the hand of his Grace, and enables them by his Holy Spirit, for he gives the Mouth and the Tongue, he makes deaf, dumb, blind, and reſtores the eye-ſight; he calls things that are not as if they were. <hi>Matth.</hi> 20. <hi>Exod.</hi> 4. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.</p>
            <p>When he deſignes for himſelf a Tabernacle, he calls by name a <hi>Bezaleel,</hi> and fills him with his Spirit of Wiſdom, of Underſtanding and knowledge, in all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Workmanſhip, <hi>Exod.</hi> 31. When he reſolves to deliver the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> from their <hi>Babyloniſh</hi> Captivity, and to build the Temple of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> he hath at his Command <hi>Cyrus, Darius,</hi> and <hi>Artaxerxes, Acts</hi> 14. He ſtirs up <hi>Zerobabels, Eſdras,</hi> and <hi>Nehemiahs.</hi> Likewiſe when he intends to repair the breaches of his Houſe, and to increaſe the Kingdom of our Lord and Saviour, he makes Servants and fit Agents, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtows upon them ſufficient Graces for ſuch a noble Work, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 8. <hi>Mat.</hi> 21. As he hath never left himſelf without witneſs in doing good, thus he hath never been without witneſſes to declare his Sacred Truth, <hi>Luk</hi> 19. By the mouth of Babes he perfects his praiſe, and as our Saviour told the Jews, <hi>If theſe held their peace, the ſtones would cry out,</hi> Luk 19. God will rather pluck the Pillars of the Idols Temples, to prop up his Church rather than to ſuffer it to fall down; he will change the Wolves into Lambs, and the Lambs into Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heards rather than that his Sheep ſhould want their neceſſary Paſture. He chooſeth the feeble things of this World, to confound the ſtrong, the deſpicable, and ſuch as are not to deſtroy ſuch as are, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.</p>
            <p>Thus God never leaves his Church without ſome te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of his favour, ſome powerful inſtrument of his Grace; but many times it happens, that when he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moves one good thing from us, he beſtows upon us ſomething more rare and excellent. This conſideration
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:41646:116" rendition="simple:additions"/>glads the Heart of <hi>Joſeph</hi> upon his Death-bed, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by what he ſaid to his Brethren, <hi>I am going to dye, but God will not fail to viſit you, and cauſe you to go up from hence into the Land, that he ſwore unto Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, Iſaac, and Jacob,</hi> Gen. 50. For inſtead of a <hi>Joſeph</hi> who had occaſioned their Bondage, God raiſed up a <hi>Moſes,</hi> who deliver'd them with a mighty hand, and a ſtretched-out Arm, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 2. Thus God took up <hi>Elijah</hi> with a Chariot of Fire, but he gave unto <hi>Eliſha</hi> a double portion of his Maſters Spirit, and cauſed his Glorious Miracles to appear with greater admiration. Likewiſe our Lord and Saviour, when he had finiſhed the great work of our Redemption, he aſcended up into Heaven. A Cloud conveying him up to the Throne of his Glory; but according to his promiſe, he hath not left us deſtitute, but hath ſent us the Comſorter to dwell with us for ever, namely, the Spirit of Truth whom the world ſeeth not, nor cannot know, <hi>John</hi> 14. Chriſts Corporal preſence was enjoyed but by a ſmall number of People, but this Divine Spirit is like a large River that ſwells and runs over every where, <hi>John</hi> 7. This Holy Spirit is not only with us, but alſo within us, He is poured out into our Hearts, He Seals us for the day of Redemption, He is the earneſt of our Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance, until the full conſummation of the Glory re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved for us in Heaven; Therefore when this mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful Saviour ſaw his Apoſtles afflicted in an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary manner for his Leaving of the World, he ſpeaks to them in this Language, Becauſe I have ſaid theſe things unto you, Sorrow hath filled your Hearts; Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs I tell you the truth, it is expedient for you that I go away, for if I go not away the Comforter will not come unto you; But if I depart I will ſend him unto you, <hi>John</hi> 16. When <hi>St. Paul</hi> took his laſt farewel of the Elders and People of the Church of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> they wept bitterly, being grieved to the Heart, becauſe he had ſaid, <hi>That none of them ſhould ſee his
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:41646:116"/>face any more.</hi> But to comfort them, he aſſures them that in Heaven they had a Father and a Protector, and ſuch a Shepherd as would never forſake them; I commend you, ſaid he, <hi>To God, and to the word of his Grace, which is able to build you up, and to give you an inheritance among all them which are ſanctified.</hi> Act. 20. Remember therefore O Man of God, ſeriouſly to conſider all theſe things; If the Lord who hath called thee to the Sacred Functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Miniſtry, continues thee in the world; la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor with courage and diligence in thine Holy employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; Be not tired in the ſervice of this good Maſter and merciful Saviour; fight the good fight of the Faith, endure patiently all manner of Labors, as a good Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier of Jeſus Chriſt; be as earneſt and as careful for the Lord's Sheep, as <hi>Jacob</hi> was for thoſe of <hi>Laban;</hi> Here what he profeſſed of himſelf, <hi>In the day the drought con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed me, and the froſt by night, and my ſleep departed from mine eyes,</hi> Gen. 20. <hi>Jacob</hi> endured patiently theſe grievous pains and labor, and the time of his ſervice, ſeem'd to him to be but of a few days, becauſe of the love that he did bear unto <hi>Rachel;</hi> Likewiſe thou wilt joyfully endure the troubles of thine Office: digeſt with patience all the inconveniencies, if thou doſt ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely love the Lord Jeſus, and his Heavenly Spouſe. If thou doſt eſteem the ſalvation of Souls, for whom Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt hath ſuffered death; if thou haſt well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood the Excellency of thine Heavenly Reward, and the Glory prepared for thee, when thou ſhalt have fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed the time of thy painful and difficult ſervice, and of thy mortal Race; for they who bring many to Right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eouſneſs ſhall ſhine as the Stars, for ever and ever, <hi>Dan.</hi> 12. <hi>Jacob</hi> had to do with a deceitful and unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful man; But God is not as Man, that he ſhould Lye, or as the Son of Man, that he ſhould Repent! <hi>Gen.</hi> 23.

            <p>If it is the Lord's pleaſure to leſſen thy task, ſo that inſtead of employing thee in his Vineyard, he intends to take thee up into his Kingdom, to drink there of his new Wine; if at the time that thou thinkeſt of ſow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with Tears, thou art tranſported to the place where thou mayeſt reap with Songs of Triumph; If in lieu of the oppoſition which thou muſt ſuffer from ſinners, God will grant to thee his Eternal Conſolations, and receive thee into the harmonious Societies of the Church Triumphant, adore his Goodneſs, and his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Mercy; caſt thy ſelf into his hands, and reſolve chearfully, to will, what is pleaſing to him; if du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring thine abode in this Valley of Tears, God hath given thee a livelyhood, and if thou haſt found in him thy joy, thy ſatisfaction, and thy greateſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, Death will be thy greateſt advantage; thou ſhalt find in thy Saviour, thy Reſt, thy Glory, and Eternal Delights, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.

            <p>Our great God and merciful Lord, hath not only ſaid in general, that he is the Judge, the Protector, and Comforter of the Widow; But he hath vouchſaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto ſome his moſt ſignal Favors and extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Bleſſings; In the Reign of <hi>Abab,</hi> while a cruel Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine overſpread the Land; God ſent the Prophet <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jah</hi> to a poor Widow of <hi>Sarephtah,</hi> who was preparing her ſelf and her Son to dye, as ſoon as they had eaten a little remnant of Meal and Oil that was left; but the Holy Prophet comforted her in this manner, Thus ſaith the Lord, the God of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> the barrel of Meal ſhall not waſte, neither ſhall the cruſe of Oil fail, until the day that the Lord ſendeth Rain upon the Earth, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 5. Many Widows have been comforted, in ſuch a miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous manner, for God hath ſo ordered it, that their proviſions have not failed; although it may be, that they have not enjoyed any unuſual Plenty: yet this wiſe Purveyor hath furniſhed them, the things that have been neceſſary for them; ſo that not only, both they and their Children have ſubſiſted in the greateſt calamities, but they have had the Honor of aſſiſting God's Prophets; and as that poor Widow of the Goſpel gave Alms out of her poverty; ſuch Mites have
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:41646:118" rendition="simple:additions"/>been more pleaſing to God, than the Treaſuries of the wealthy. Morever, when the Son of God was in the World, he was pleaſed to expreſs how much care and compaſſion he had of Widows, for when he met, at the Gate of the City of <hi>Nain,</hi> a poor Widow weeping bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly for her only Son, that was carried out to be buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he was moved with a tender feeling of her afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, therefore he raiſed the young man to life again, and reſtored him to his Mother. It was alſo at the ſolicitation of ſome devout Widows, that <hi>St. Peter</hi> raif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Dorcas</hi> from death to life. I muſt needs take notice here of an admirable ſtory, proper to comfort every faithful ſervant of God. The Widow of a deceaſed Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, made this bitter complaint unto <hi>Eliſha, Thy Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant my Husband is dead, and thou knoweſt that thy Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant did fear the Lord, and the creditor is come to take un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him my two Sons to be bond-men,</hi> 2 King 4. God, who hears the cry of the afflicted, had compaſſion of that poor diſtreſſed Widow, ſo that he gave unto her, by <hi>Eliſha's</hi> means, in a wonderful manner, ſufficient for the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of her debts, and for to nouriſh her Family; by this glorious example, God declares the care that he will have of his Prophets Widows, whilſt they walk in his fear, and continue in his Holy Covenant.</p>
            <p>In ſhort, the modern and antient Hiſtories, are full of notable examples of wiſe and vertuous Widows, that have diſcreetly governed their Families, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whom God's Bleſſings have viſibly appeared.</p>
            <p>Almighty God, who is wonderful in all his Works, doth ſometimes order affairs in ſuch a manner, that Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers don't gather up for their Children, but he gives to ſome ſuch Children in his Mercy, that make provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for their Fathers; ſuch are an extraordinary Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to their Family, as <hi>Joſeph</hi> was to <hi>Jacob</hi> and his Houſhold. Such wiſe and vertuous Children, who are ſo neceſſary to their Parents, whom they Love and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, might, out of their violent affection for them,
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:41646:118" rendition="simple:additions"/>ſpeak unto Death in the language of the young man of the Goſpel; <hi>Suffer me to go firſt and bury my Father.</hi> Let me alone awhile in the world, ſuffer me to live, O death, until I have accompanied my Parents to their Grave, until I have cloſed their Eye-lids, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed the laſt duties that Nature requires. But hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken officious Son! what the Lord ſaith to thee, <hi>Suffer the dead to bury the dead,</hi> but thou follow me. Leave to them, that remain after thee, the care of Worldly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, but do thou yield thy ſelf at God's Call. Thy Charity for others muſt not cauſe thee to be cruel to thy ſelf, and diſobedient to the Commands of thy God. Fear not to leave thy Father and Mother, when thou art going to caſt thy ſelf into the raviſhing embraces of thy Spiritual Bridegroom, and of thine Heavenly Father. The great God, who hath given thee, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther lent thee to them, and who cauſed them to ſubſiſt before thou hadſt a Being, can feed and bleſs them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out thee; his Mercy is not tied to thy Perſon, nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd to thine induſtry. When our Lord and Saviour was upon the Croſs, ſeeing the Bleſſed Virgin and the Diſciple whom he loved, ſaid to his Mother, Woman, <hi>behold thy Son,</hi> and to <hi>St. John, Son, behold thy Mother,</hi> John 19. and from that hour that Diſciple took her unto his own home. In the like manner when God cals unto his Eternal Reſt, him who was the ſupporter of his Family, as <hi>Joſeph</hi> was, he provides for them by ſome other means; ſo that if <hi>Elkanah</hi> had good cauſe to ſay to his Wife, when ſhe wept, becauſe ſhe had no Child, Am not I better to thee then ten Sons? 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1. we may ſay with more reaſon, that God's Grace, his Aſſiſtance, and the Comforts of his Holy Spirit, are better worth than Ten thouſand Children.</p>
            <p>The ſtrongeſt Paſſion, and that which I judge to be, the moſt apt to hinder a good Man, is that which Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and Mothers have for their little ones; eſpecially if they be in an age unable to help themſelves; but that this
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:41646:119" rendition="simple:additions"/>natural paſſion may not hurry us beyond the limits pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by Reaſon and Piety; conſider well the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe that God made to <hi>Abraham, I am thy God, and the God of thy ſeed after thee,</hi> Gen. 17. and what <hi>St. Peter</hi> told the Jews, <hi>To you and to your Children was the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe made, and to all ſuch as are afar off, as many as the Lord our God ſhall call,</hi> Acts 2. eſpecially, meditate well up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and imprint in your minds that which God ſpeaks unto you from Heaven, by the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah, Leave me thy Fatherleſs Children, and I will give them to eat, and let thy Widows truſt in me,</hi> Jer. 49. God is the Father of us all, but more eſpecially of the Fatherleſs, he hath compaſſion of them, and provides for all their neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; thy Children are more tender to him than to thee, for thou haſt been but a feeble inſtrument in his hand, to put them into the world; but he is the Creator of their Soul, the faſhioner of their Body, and the redeemer of them both: He loves them with a ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and more conſtant Love than the beſt Fathers, and the moſt tender-hearted Mothers; therefore he aſſures us by his Holy Prophet, that when the Mother ſhould forget the Child, unto whom ſhe gives ſuck; and when ſhe ſhould have no pity of the Fruit of her Womb, he will never forget us; ſo that all the Children that fear God, may ſay as <hi>David, When my Father and my Mother ſhould have forſaken me, the Lord will receive me.</hi> Pſal. 27.</p>
            <p>Seeing that <hi>Job</hi> hath had a care of the Orphans, <hi>Job</hi> 31. and <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Daughter hath had compaſſion of the Tears of a little ſtrange Child, how much more ſhall God, who is the Father of Mercies, and the God of all Comfort, have pity of Children, that he hath redeemed with the precious Bloud of his only Son? <hi>Exod.</hi> 2. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. Seeing that he hears the cries of the young Ravens, he will ſooner hear the Prayers, Sighs, and Tears of his Servants Children, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 147. <hi>Matt.</hi> 6. he cloaths the Graſs of the Fields which to day is,
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:41646:119" rendition="simple:additions"/>and to morrow is caſt into the Oven, <hi>Gen.</hi> 21. how much rather will he cloath your Children, O ye of little Faith? Doth your Heavenly Father nouriſh the Birds of the Air, and will not he rather feed your Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, that are better worth than all the Birds together? <hi>Jon.</hi> 4. In ſhort, ſeeing God hath had compaſſion of little <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> and of the Children of <hi>Ninivy,</hi> how much rather will he regard Children that have been ſanctified to him from their Mothers womb?</p>
            <p>Our Lord Jeſus Chriſt when he was on Earth, took up in his Arms the little Children that were brought unto him, laid his hands upon them, and recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them to God his Father; and now that he is in Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, his Love and tender compaſſion for them, is no leſs; Therefore if we offer him our Children with all our hearts, he will take them into his protection, he will ſtretch over them the Arms of his Mercy, and will never take them away again. In ſhort, ſeeing that he promiſeth to them the Kingdom of Heaven, and his Eternal Felicities, he will never with-hold from them things needful for this preſent life.</p>
            <p>We can do nothing without God, but God can do all things without us. A great many Children become debauch'd, and are ſpoil'd in their Parents over-fond tuition, wherecas many that are out of their ſight, and that live when they are departed; ſhew good exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Piety and Godlineſs, for example, in <hi>Iſaack</hi>'s Houſe, in the preſence of this Holy Man, there was a prophane <hi>Eſau,</hi> a Glutton; whereas <hi>Jacob</hi> that lived at a diſtance from his Parents, when he fled for fear of his Brother, had always before his eyes the <hi>fear of Iſaack his Father,</hi> Gen. 27. Gen. 31. that is to ſay, the God whom his Father worſhipped. In <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Houſe, <hi>Ruben</hi> defiled his Father's Bed, in an inceſtuous man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, whereas <hi>J<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſeph</hi> in <hi>Potiphera's</hi> Houſe, choſe rather an apparent death, and preſent ſufferings, than to touch his Maſters Wiſe, <hi>Gen.</hi> 39. <hi>David</hi> had the unhappineſs
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:41646:120"/>to ſee ſome of his Children guilty of Inceſt and Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; whereas <hi>Joas</hi> and <hi>Joſias,</hi> two Orphan-Princes, in their tendereſt infancy became Vertuous and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Kings, zealous for the ſervice of God. How ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Children are there, who, notwithſtanding all the care and labor of their Fathers, fall into extremity of miſery? How many are taken from their Parents em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces, and dragg'd from thence to the Gallows? whereas there are others that without Father, or Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents aſſiſtance, don't only eſcape grievous dangers, but riſe to Honors and Dignities, as <hi>Joſeph</hi> in <hi>Aegypt, Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel</hi> in <hi>Babylon,</hi> and <hi>Eſther</hi> that was Fatherleſs, and a poor Captive, became a Queen; and moreover, God made uſe of her, and of her credit, to deliver his People from <hi>Haman's</hi> conſpiracy. We ſee every day that God bleſſeth, in an extraordinary manner, many Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phans. Caſt your Eyes upon the Children of the bleſſed Martyrs, and thou ſhalt perceive many that God hath made notable inſtances of his eſpecial favors, and of the Mercy that he promiſeth to ſhew unto thouſand Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations of them that ſerve him, and obey his Holy Commands. Thou ſhalt find ſome that have much more happineſs in this life, than the poſterity of the Perſecutors; Thou ſhalt ſee them with aſtoniſhment, beſtow their Alms upon the Children of ſuch as have plundered their Houſes, and ſpoiled their Goods.</p>
            <p>Whilſt you are yet in being, exhort your Children to fear God, to ſerve, and to addict themſelves, with all their Heart, to the ſtudy of Piety, that hath the promiſes of this life, and of the life to come: Teach them firſt to ſeek the Kingdom of God, and its Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, and all theſe things ſhall be added to them over and above.</p>
            <p>Finally, when your life ſhould be much more uſeful to your Children than it is, remember what our Lord and Saviour ſaith, <hi>He that loves Son or Daughter, more than him, is not worthy of him.</hi> Heaven is far more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:41646:120" rendition="simple:additions"/>than the Earth. The Salvation and the Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of our Souls is to be preferr'd to all the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations of Fleſh and Bloud. It is not juſt, that ſuch as have given us, or to whom we have given the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of a temporal life, ſhould hinder us from the fruition of a Spiritual and Eternal Life. Beſides, when we recommend them to God, we put them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the protection of a true, and of a wiſe Friend, who is acquainted with their neceſſities, who is ſo Good to procure them that which ſhall be needful for them, and Almighty to accompliſh all things which may be for their advantage.</p>
            <p>Let us therefore conclude, that it is the duty of a good Father that fears God, not to reſiſt death, not to fly from it when the Lord calls; but according to the good example of the antient Patriarchs, he ought to end his days willingly with the praiſes of God in his mouth, and with exhortation to his Children to love him, fear him, and ſerve him with all their heart, to continue in his Holy Covenant, and to prefer him to all the Riches and Honors of this miſerable Earth. And as when our Saviour had beſtowed his Bleſſings up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Diſciples, a Cloud carried him out of their ſight into Heaven; Likewiſe when a good Chriſtian ſhall have thus given his Bleſſings to his Children, he will ſhut his eyes to all inferior things, and think upon nothing but upon the Eternal Bliſs of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Paradiſe.</p>
            <p>If God calls us to himſelf in a miſerable and wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed time, when our beloved Infants are weeping about our Bed, ready to ſay to us, as <hi>Iſaack</hi> unto <hi>Abraham, My Father, here is Wood, a Fire, and a Knife, but where is the Beaſt for a Burnt-offering?</hi> Gen. 22. God cauſeth the viſible ſignes of his heavy diſpleaſure to appear eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where. In every corner we ſee nothing but Fire and Sword. Death's frightful Image, and the fearful ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of Maſacres, do ſcare and terrify us; Deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:41646:121" rendition="simple:additions"/>is come into the Holy places, the Fire hath reacht as far as God's own Sanctuary, and no body is able to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver us. The deluge of God's wrath hath overſpread our Land in ſuch a manner, that, as <hi>Noah</hi>'s Dove, we cannot find where to pitch our feet. All our expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is, that God would alſo reach down his hand un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us from above, to receive us into that Ark which is above the Heavens, and unto which your Soul is now departing, <hi>Gen.</hi> 8. If our dear Children ſpeak unto us in this Language; Let us, with the courage, aſſurance, and faith of the Father of the Faithful, return unto them this anſwer, <hi>My Children, the Lord will provide,</hi> Gen. 12. Rom. 4. It is he that acts beyond appearance, and againſt all hope, who cauſeth the dead to live, and calls things that are not, as if they were; he will ſend to you his good Angels to help you in all your neceſſities when you ſhall be reduc'd to the uttermoſt miſery, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to receive the laſt ſtroke of death; God's hands will ſtop the ſword of his juſtice, he will change your crying and fears into joy and Eternal gladneſs. There will be ſome Holy and devout Soul, that loves the publick peace and tranquility, that will bring to you the Olive-branch of Peace. God can appeaſe the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt with his breath, at his Command the winds will be ſtill, and the roaring Waves that are ready to devour you, will return to their former tranquility. Otherwiſe he will preſerve you miraculouſly alive in the midſt of the greateſt troubles, and moſt fearful confuſion. And as <hi>Abraham</hi> found a Lamb intangled in a Buſh; Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in the midſt of the ſharpeſt ſtorms of affliction, and in the moſt intricate difficulties that you dread, you ſhall find unexpected ſweetneſs and comforts. And as ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral colours of the beautiful Rainbow, appear upon the Cloud, whence proceeds the Storms and the Rain; Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe thus, in the greateſt afflictions, God will give you ſome teſtimonies of his fatherly care, and of his Divine love. The aſſurance that you ſhall repoſe in God, ſhall
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:41646:121" rendition="simple:additions"/>never be confounded, for the love of God is ſpread in your hearts by the Holy Spirit, that he hath given you. The hotter the fire of affliction ſhall be, the greater, and the more miracles it ſhall bring forth. The higher the waters of your Floud ſhall riſe, the nearer they will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach your Souls good, and the nearer you will draw to Heaven, the place of your Souls birth: Comfort therefore your ſelves, my dear Children, and aſſure your ſelves, that by the favourable aſſiſtance of God's Grace and Mercy, we ſhall ſee one another again ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily. I ſhall not return to you, but you ſhall come to me, for I am going to that large and magnificent Dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, whither our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt is gone before, to prepare a place for us, and where he will embrace us all. I am going up to my Father and your Father, to my God and to your God.</p>

                  <hi>O Almighty Governor of this great World, ſeeing that thou haſt granted to me the honor of repreſenting the Perſon of my Prince thy living Image; it is but juſt that I ſhould return unto thee my unfeigned thanks, for ſuch a ſpecial Favor, for I ſhould not have this Power, if it were not given to me from above; and if thou who art the King of Kings, and holdeſt, in thine Almighty hand, the Hearts of Princes, hadſt not cauſed the ſuperior Powers to favor my Perſon. Give me Grace never to forget that the Perſons that I am to Govern, are not my Slaves, but the Subjects of my Prince: moreover, they are thy Creatures and Children; it belongs not to me to diſpoſe of them at my pleaſure, according to my paſſions, but to obſerve the Orders that have been given me, and to obey thy Divine Commandments. Let me behave my ſelf as if my Prince were always, and every where, at my elbows, to be a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of all my actions. But eſpecially, let me remember that I am always before thine holy Eyes, that behold my Heart, and read my moſt ſecret thoughts. Let me conſider night and day, that I muſt give an account, to my Great Maſter, of the Stewardſhip intruſted in my hands; and that I muſt one day appear before thy dreadful Tribunal, where diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſing

Let not the care of the time to come, trouble the quiet of my Soul; thou canſt raiſe up other Governors, unto whom thou canſt grant a Spirit of Wiſdom and Diſcretion, with an happy and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Governance, whilſt I ſhall reſt for ever from all my la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors and cares, and when I ſhall have overcome Satan, the World, Sin, and Death, and kept thy Works until the end, thou wilt give me into my hands a never-fading Palm, thou wilt put upon my Head a Glorious Crown, and into my mouth the Songs of the Bleſſed, in whoſe company I ſhall ſing Praiſes and Tranksgivings unto thee for ever and ever,</hi> Amen.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>O God of Hoſts, I have been perſwaded that this em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, in which I have engaged my ſelf, for the ſervice of my King and Countrey, would not be diſpleaſing to thy Divine Majeſty; ſeeing that thou haſt appointed Military Laws unto thy People, and haſt been ſo Gracious to them, as to govern their Armies, march out before them, and Command in Chief, when they have encounter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with their Enemies. Although thy Son is the Prince of Peace, his firſt Miniſter and Fore-runner did not forbid the uſe of Weapons to the Soldiers that reſorted to him, but only to be content with their wages, and to do violence
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:41646:124"/>to no man; beſides, the Holy Apoſtles teach us, that it is not in vain that thou haſt put the Sword into the hands of Soveraign Princes and Kings, who are the Images of thine Almighty power; and of thy uncontroulable Juſtice. Let me never appear at the head of an Army, or of a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, but let me imagine my Prince to be there preſent, as if I were to ſight before his eyes; but let me chiefly remember, that I am in the ſight of thy Holy Angels, and of thee, who art the King of Kings, of all the Nations of the World; and of their Armies. Let not the power which thou haſt given me over others, cauſe me to neglect the obedience that I owe unto thee my great God and Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator: Let not the honor of being a Captain, make me for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get that I am a Soldier of Jeſus Chriſt; who Judges, and Wars according to right. Let not the Sword that I car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry at my ſide, hinder me from receiving into my Heart, the Sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God; that is ſharper than a two-edged ſword, that ſearcheth to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion of the Soul and Spirit, Joynts and Marrow. Give me with this Heavenly Sword, the Breaſt-plate of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, and the Helmet of Salvation; and eſpecially, give me the Buckler of Faith, that I may be able to quench all the fiery Darts of the Devil. O my God! cloath me with the Strength and Vertue of thy Holy Spirit, that I may reſiſt all my ſpiritual Enemies, and obtain a Glorious Victory. Give me Grace to overcome Sin, the World, and my Self; all my Paſſions and wicked Luſts, that I may ſee Hell confounded, and Satan cruſh'd under my feet. Laſtly, Give me ſtrength to fight with courage againſt Death; and to overcome it. O great and living God! it is not neceſſary that any ſhould remember me, that I am Mortal, becauſe Death is to be ſeen every day before me; I walk continually upon its Footſteps, if it gives me an aſſault in the midſt of my Proſperities, and in the firſt increaſe of my Glory; I ſhall then go to obtain, a more happy and magnificent Victory, than theſe earthly ones; for it is far more Honourable to conquer Death, and triumph over Hell; than to be a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:41646:125"/>of thouſands of Mortal Men. And if this cruel death carries me away in a time that my Life and Services are ſo uſeful to my Prince and Countrey; Let me learn to reſt upon thy wonderful Providence, that cannot want Captains and Soldiers: Thou wilt raiſe up after me, more happy and victorious Commanders, but I ſhall enter into thy Heavenly Reſt and Peace, that reigns in thy King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. Lord Jeſus! I ſhall gather the fruits of a bleſſed immortality, which have been purchaſed by thy wonderful Victories, and by thy glorious ſufferings, and I ſhall ſhare in the joy of thine Eternal Triumphs. Let this death therefore come when it pleaſeth, I ſhall be ready to ſay to it as</hi> St. Paul. I have fought the good fight, I have finiſhed my courſe, I have kept the faith; hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth, there is laid up for me a Crown of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which, the Lord, the Righteous Judge ſhall give me at that day, <hi>Amen.</hi>

Let me always conſider, that when I have done judging others, I ſhall be judged my ſelf, and nothing ſhall be able to oppoſe the Decrees of thine infinite wiſdom. If at any time the conſiderations of Fleſh and Bloud, tempt me to evil, let me recal to mind my approaching Death, that I may be bridled with an Holy Dread; let me conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that it warns me already to appear in perſon before thy Tribunal, where I muſt give up an account, not only of my Words, and of my Actions, but of my moſt ſecret Thoughts, and of the moſt plauſible Acts of Judicature.

                  <hi>O<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Shepheard, and Biſhop of our Souls, I cannot ſufficiently acknowledge and admire the Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Mercies which thou haſt beſtowed upon me; thou haſt called me to an Office, in which the Angels of Heaven eſteem it an Honor for themſelves to be employed, and in which thou thy ſelf haſt been diligent during the days of thy Fleſh, Thou haſt been pleaſed to make me one of the Miniſters of thy People, and to commit to my truſt, that which thou doſt cheriſh, as the deareſt and moſt precious thing of the World, namely, thy Church, for which thou haſt expreſſed ſo much love, as to give thy ſelf for it, and to redeem it with thy precious Bloud. But alas, my Lord, and my God, who is ſufficient for theſe things? The employment is heavy and painful, and I am weak and feeble. The World hates and perſecutes us moſt vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently, and the Devil, like a roaring Lion, walks conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually about us, to ſeek to devour the Shepheard with his Flock. In thine own Inheritance I am forced to ſwallow ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny bitter Fruits, and drink Waters of affliction. I find more Briers and Thorns, than Flowers and Roſes; They that ſhould encourage me in the midſt of ſo many Labors, do often weaken my Hands, and afflict my Heart; that which ſhould cauſe my great'ſt joy, and fill my Soul with the ſweeteſt Comforts, is the occaſion of my deepeſt ſorrows, and of my moſt violent grief. Merciful Lord, whilſt thou

Open the door wide to the Gospel of thy Grace, that all people of the Earth may learn to ſerve and worſhip thee in Spirit and in Truth. Defeat all the Counſels, and all the ſtrength that riſeth up againſt thee, and bring all thoughts to thine obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. Let the World be confounded in all its purpoſes, and let it never have the power to ſcare me by its threaten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, or to corrupt me by its fair promiſes. Let Satan once more fall from Heaven as a Lightning, and let him be for ever ſhut up in the bottomleſs pit. Shut up the mouths of all falſe Prophets, and let thy Truth be victorious over Error, that we may ſee the Congregations of thy true Catholick Church increaſe in number of perſons,</hi> that may wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip thee with more Affection and Zeal, <hi>or rather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe in them thy Grace and Heavenly Bleſſings. O let me always conſider, that the Sheep that I am to feed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long not to me, nor to any mortal Man, but to thee Lord Jeſus, who haſt created them by thine infinite power, and redeemed them by thy wonderful Goodneſs. Thou haſt wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly offered thy ſelf to the ſufferings of a painful death, that thou mighteſt deliver them from the Wolfs Paw, and Claws of the infernal Lion. Let me remember that I am ſhortly to appear before thy Glorious preſence, and to give thee an account of my Stewardſhip. O Lord, who knoweſt all things, unto whom nothing is hid, thou ſeeſt the very bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of my Heart, and ſpieſt my moſt ſecret thoughts. Thou knoweſt how faithfully and affectionately, I have been em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in thy ſervice; I have led thy Sheep to the wholſome feeding of thy Heavenly Paſtures. I have led them to the Waters that burſt forth unto Eternal Life; my Conſcience bears me witneſs before thee and thy Holy Angels, that I have declared nothing, neither by Word nor Writing, but that which I firmly believe to be agreeable to the Oracles of the Prophets, Apoſtles, and Evangeliſts. I have drawn out of the Sacred Treaſuries of thy word, things new and old,
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:41646:127"/>for the beautifying of thy Houſe, and for the inſtruction of ſuch as dwell there. I have labour'd day and night in the hings that thou haſt put into my heart for thy Glory, for the advance of thy Kingdom, and the comfort of thy Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. In the important paſſages of my life, I have not ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken counſel from Fleſh and Bloud, but I have preferred the Honour of thy great Name, and the Glory of thy Divine Truth, to all Earthly advantages, and to my particular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt. I have deſpiſed all the Riches of this World, and the Honors of the Age, for the ſake of the ſpiritual Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuries, and of that Heavenly Light which thou haſt put into me, as into an Earthly Veſſel, that all Glory may be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed to thee, who art the Author of all good, and of all perfect Gifts. My moſt delicious Meat, and my moſt plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant Drink, was to do thy Holy Will, and to perfect thy Work. I have taken a ſingular delight in declaring the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Councils of thy Wiſdom, and diſcovering the Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of thy Kingdom, I have ſhared in the evils and ſufferings of thy Members, I have not been ſparing of the comforts which thou haſt furniſhed me in all my afflictions, and temptations. Thy Holy Law is in my Heart, and thy Gospel is there engraven with the finger of thy Bleſſed Spirit. Thou haſt kindled in me an earneſt deſire of ſaving Souls, and bringing them to Righteouſneſs. O Lord, who ſearcheſt into the bottom of the moſt ſecret Hearts, Thou knoweſt that I may ſay with the Holy Prophet,</hi> The zeal of thine Houſe hath caten me up. <hi>Or with the Apoſtle,</hi> The care of thy Church cometh upon me daily: <hi>But for all this, I pretend not to be juſtified in thy preſence, I am ſo far from reſting upon mine own Righteouſneſs, and of being puft up with the opinion of my deſervings, that I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs my ſelf a poor and a miſerable ſinner; therefore with my whole Heart, I deſire the forgiveneſs of my great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections and miſcarriages, which I have been guilty of in thy ſervice; I have not been enflam'd with a Charity pure enough, nor with a diſintereſſed Zeal; I have been ſometimes too indulgent, and ſometimes too ſevere in the reprehenſion

Therefore I pour forth my Soul before thee, and acknowledge that thou haſt heard me, and accepted the contrition of my heart, and heard the voice of my Tears. Thou ſtrengtheneſt my Faith, raiſeſt my Hopes, and filleſt my Soul with refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and excellent conſiderations of thy Love: Thou cauſeſt me to taſt the Salvation which thou often preacheſt to others.

Suffer not the World, nor Hell, to pluck them out of thine Hand, that nothing may ſeparate them from the love which thou haſt ſhewed to them in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt thine only Son. Let not Death terrify them, but let it rather rejoyce and comfort them, becauſe, that it is the entrance that leads to the Glorious Dwelling of their Heavenly Father, and to the Celeſtial</hi> Paradiſe; <hi>whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever change or alteration ſhall happen here below, let them always lift up their Eyes to thee, who art the ſame yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day and to day, and ſhalt be the ſame for ever. Let them never forget their Duty to thee, from whom they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived their Being and Life, that they may prefer the Glory of thy Great Name, the Purity of thy Worſhip, and the hopes of thy Heavenly Kingdom, to all worldly Glory, Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence, Riches, advantages, and Pleaſures of the Fleſh. O God, who art the Creator and Father of their Spirits; cauſe them to endure a thouſand Deaths, and reduce them to nothing, from whence thou haſt fetched them, rather than to ſuffer them to be enſlaved to Vice, Error, or to Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition that robs thee, O Great God, of thine Honor, to aſcribe it to the Creature. Merciful, and Almighty Lord, I ſhall not ſay to thee as</hi> Eſau <hi>did to</hi> Iſaac, <hi>when he had bleſſed</hi> Jacob; My Father, haſt thou but one Bleſſing? <hi>for I am certain that thou haſt an infinite number, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny inexhauſible Fountains, of all manner of Bleſſings; but I beſeech thee, with all the Zeal and Earneſtneſs that I can, to Bleſs my dear Children with thy Heavenly and eſpecial
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:41646:130"/>Favors; take them into thy protection, bear them in thy Hands, embrace them with thy tender compaſſion, and let them be as dear to thee as the Apple of thine Eyes. Let thy fear be always before them. Let them love thee with all their Heart, and ſerve thee with all their Powers that they may Glorify thee in proſperity, and adverſity, in Life and Death, that Chriſt may be their gain, whether they live, or whether they dye; but I am now leaving the World and my Children without Grief, or miſtruſting thy care of them, I am aſcending with joy up to thee, who art my God, my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and their Father, and I truſt in thy great and Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Mercies, that one day we ſhall ſee one another in thine Heavenly Kingdom, when we ſhall be admitted to behold thy Face, which ſhall fill us with unſpeakable Gladneſs and Pleaſure,</hi> Amen.</p>

            <argument>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Firſt Conſolation againſt the fears of Death;</hi> God will not forſake us in our moſt grievous pangs.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>MAn is naturally afraid of pain, and abhors all ſufferings and grief; now the moſt of us are perſwaded that it is impoſſible to dye without enduring great pains; therefore they abhor Death, not ſo much for its own ſake, as for the evils that it cauſeth to ſuffer.</p>
            <p>That we may be able to drive away this ill-ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Fear, and ſtrengthen our minds againſt all appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions; we muſt firſt conſider, that death is not ſo dreadful and painful, as commonly imagined; the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt calls it a Sleep, and the Heathens themſelves have ſaid, that Sleep is Death's Couſen-german, and the Image of frozen Death: Now Sleep creeps upon us inſenſibly, it charms our Sences ſoftly, and with inviſible Fetters it ties and ſtops all our moſt active faculties; although we ſleep every night, we are not able to diſcover how this happens to us. It is ſaid of <hi>Socrates,</hi> one of the moſt famous Men of the firſt Ages, when he had, in obedience to the Decree of the Judges of <hi>Athens,</hi> drunk poiſon, when he felt the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nom benumming his Sences, and Death creeping in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Veins, he declared with a pleaſant countenance, <hi>That he had never ſwallowed anything more ſweet and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable.</hi> Nothing can be imagin'd more pleaſant, than the death of the old Patriarchs. The Holy Scripture tells us, That when <hi>Jacob</hi> had made an end of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding his Sons, he gathered up his Feet into the Bed, and yielded up the Ghoſt, <hi>Gen.</hi> 49. The ſame is related of King <hi>David,</hi> That when he had perſwaded
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:41646:131" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>Solomon to fear God, and to do juſtice, he ſlept with his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,</hi> 1 King 1. God is as merciful to many in theſe latter days, to cauſe them to dye in ſpeaking and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling upon his Holy name; their Souls are not pluckt from them by violence, but of their own accord they ſeparate from the Body, and fly into Heaven with an Holy chearfulneſs. The ſeparation of ſuch Souls from the Body, happens without pain, grief, or ſuffering. Such are like to a Taper, that extinguiſheth without any blaſt of Wind, of its own accord, when the Wax that kept it alive, and nouriſheth its flame is totally ſpent. If you perceive ſome toſt and tortured with grievous pangs in their death-bed, they are not properly the pangs of death, but the laſt ſtruglings and motions of life; for I cannot imagine, that at the moment of the ſeparation of our Souls from our Bodies, we ſuffer any pain, becauſe at that inſtant, all the Senſes are then lulled aſleep, and our Bodies have no more ſtrength, nor life to hinder the Souls departing.</p>
            <p>Death is ſo far from being ſo dreadful and painful, as we commonly imagine, that on the contrary, it is that very thing that puts an end to all our pains and miſeries. And I am perſwaded that the diſeaſes that bring us to our graves, are not ſo grievous as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſtempers, that we endure whilſt we live here on Earth; ſuch as are a cruel Gout, a Stone in the Kidneys, or a Canker in the Breaſt, for they are tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures that rack us continually, and a Fire that conſumes us without ceaſing. But when our pains ſhould be far more ſenſible, and that we ſhould have reaſon to impute them to death, we have no reaſon therefore to fly from it, or to abhor its approaches, for otherwiſe we have as good cauſe to curſe the hour of our Birth, and weep for our Victories, for there is no Birth with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out pain, nor Victory without ſtrugling; the moſt Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and flouriſhing Laurels are watered with Bloud and Sweat.</p>
            <pb n="271" facs="tcp:41646:131" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p>The moſt excellent things are the moſt painful, and to ſpeak according to the common ſaying, that <hi>One nail drives another,</hi> ſo one evil is a Remedy to many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther evils; we commonly ſeek with an earneſt longing, as a good thing, that evil that frees us from the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent pains, that we can ſcarce endure. To be healed o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> our diſtempers, we ſwallow moſt bitter Pills and Potions, that gripe and torment our Bowels. To be freed from the Stone, we ſuffer a moſt painful cutting. And that the Gangreen that hath ſeized upon one of our Members, might not get to our Heart, we endure it with patience, to be cut off, whether it be Arm or Leg; therefore, when Death ſhould be much more grievous, bitter, and more cruel than it is commonly repreſented; yet we ought to embrace it willingly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that it delivers us not only from ſome diſeaſe or ſome particular pain, but generally from all pains, aches, and diſtempers. The Phyſick works not always out the humour that diſquiets us. When we have drawn out a Stone from the Bladder, many times others grow in the place that are worſe. The Surgeons hand, let it be never ſo perfect, anſwers not always his Patients ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation; inſtead of removing his pain, it increaſeth it; But the working and cure of Death, is always cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and never fails, the ſucceſs is always happy to a Chriſtian Soul.</p>
            <p>That I may ſupply thee with ſome comfort in the midſt of thy great pains and ſufferings, <hi>My Brother,</hi> or <hi>My Siſter,</hi> remember that theſe things happen not to thee by chance, but it is God who ſends them to thee, according to the decree of his Wiſdom. Aſcribe not thy Diſeaſe to the influences of the Stars, to blind For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, but lift up thine Eyes to his appointment, who hath ſtretched out the Heavens, and Commanded the ſucceſſion of the Seaſons, and who is the Author and Lord of thy Life. We need not tempt God, as the <hi>Philiſtins</hi> did of old, and require from him a miracle, to
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:41646:132" rendition="simple:additions"/>know if it be his hand, for God aſſures us, that he himſelf inflicts the Wound, and binds it up, that his hand ſtrikes and heals again, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 5. <hi>Affliction cometh not forth of the Duſt, neither doth trouble ſpring out of the ground,</hi> Job 5. Who is able to ſay, that theſe things are come to paſs, and the Lord hath not commanded them, doth not evil and good proceed from the appointment of the moſt High? There is no evil in the City, but God hath done it; that is to ſay, that there is no di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper, nor affliction, but he over-rules and governs it by his wonderful Providence.</p>
            <p>This perſwaſion will ſtop our murmuring in the midſt of our greateſt troubles and violent paines, it will cauſe us to ſay with <hi>David, I have held my peace Lord, and have not open'd my Lips, becauſe it was thy do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> Or if we offer to ſpeak, it ſhall be in the language of a bleſſed Servant of God, <hi>Lord, thou troubleſt me, but it is ſufficient for me to know, that it is thy hand,</hi> Job 2. As if he ſhould have ſaid, this Phyſick is very bitter. O great Phyſitian of my Soul and Body, but I will freely drink it up, becauſe thou haſt preſcribed it: It is not juſt to receive good, at the hand of God, and refuſe evil, to complain of a diſeaſe that he hath ſent us, for a few days, inſtead of bleſſing him for the health which he hath continued unto us many years. In ſhort, when our Souls ſhould be troubled with the anguiſh of death, when drops of bloud ſhould come out of our veins, we muſt in ſuch a caſe lift up our Eyes to Heaven, and ſay with our Lord and Saviour, Father, if it pleaſe thee that this Cup ſhould not paſs away from me except I drink it: Nevertheleſs, O Father, not my Will, but thy Will be done, <hi>Luk</hi> 21.</p>
            <p>This ſame conſideration will keep us from falling in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to deſpair, and from fancying, that the evils will ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low us up. For ſeeing God ſends both evil and good, and that he is faithful and juſt, that he is true and merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, he will not ſuffer us to be tempted, that is, that we
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:41646:132" rendition="simple:additions"/>ſhould be afflicted above that we are able, but with the temptation he will make away to eſcape, that we may be able to bear it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. He kindles not all his wrath at once, and employs not all his fury, he diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers not all the ſtrength of his Arm, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78. but when his anger is hotteſt, he remembers to have pity and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion on the afflicted, for he knows of what we are made, that we are but Duſt and Aſhes, <hi>Hab.</hi> 3. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>members that we are but Fleſh, that is to ſay, weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs it ſelf, a wind that paſſeth away, and returneth not again, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103. He regulates his chaſtiſements, not according to the horridneſs of our ſins, but according to our great weakneſſes, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78. Therefore when God ſpeaks of <hi>David</hi>'s Son, the true and lively Image of the Holy Seed, with which he hath conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded an Eternal Covenant, he ſpeaks in this manner, <hi>If he commits ſin, I will chaſtiſe him with the Rod of Men, and with the ſtripes of the Children of men, but my mercy ſhall not depart away from him,</hi> 2 Sam. 7. And <hi>St. Paul</hi> ſpeaking in general, of the afflictions, with which God viſits his Children, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. he ſtiles them <hi>Humane temptations,</hi> to aſſure us that they ſhall never exceed the ſtrength and power of our weak Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
            <p>The wiſe and experienced Phyſitian appoints nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Phyſick nor Bleeding to the Patient, until he hath well examined his Pulſe, and underſtood thereby the diſpoſition of his Body; and ſhall not God's Eternal Wiſdom, that never acts without good reaſon, and that perfectly knows the Pulſe and Temper of our Souls, that ſearcheth our Reins, and that ſees our very Heart, proportion his Phyſick and Remedies to our weakneſſes? for his deſign is to heal, and not to deſtroy us; He once inflicted puniſhments upon <hi>Babylon</hi> by meaſure, and numbred the Viols of his Wrath, which he pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the ſeat of the Beaſt, and ſhall not this good God meaſure the Rods, and weigh the Afflictions with
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:41646:133" rendition="simple:additions"/>which he reproves his Children? ſhall not he number their Sighs and Tears? This conſideration com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts King <hi>David, Thou,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>O God, telleſt my wandrings, put thou my tears into thy bottle, are they not in thy Book? Pſ.</hi> 56. Although Fleſh and Bloud may think o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, I am perſwaded that Diſeaſes may be looked upon as the ſweeteſt and moſt favourable afflictions. It was <hi>David</hi>'s perſwaſion, for when he was to chuſe one of theſe three Plagues, either War, Famine, or Plague, which is the moſt grievous, moſt hated, and dreadful of all diſtempers, he choſe the Plague; We ſhould never forget the reaſon of his choiſe; <hi>Let us fall now,</hi> ſaid he, to the Prophet <hi>Gad, into the hands of the Lord,</hi> for his Mercies are great; <hi>and let me not fall into the hand of Man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The evils which God ſends to us, are expreſſions of his Love, and of his Fatherly Care of us, for God begins his Judgements, that is, his Chaſtiſements, at his own Houſe, and ſhews moſt ſeverity to the Servants whom he loves beſt, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. Therefore he tells the Angel of the Church of <hi>Laodicea, As many as I love, I rebuke and chaſten,</hi> Revel. 3. The greateſt affliction that can happen to us in the World, is never to be afflicted, and the moſt grievous temptation, is never to be tempted; <hi>St Paul</hi> to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> ſpeaks moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently upon this ſubject, <hi>Forget not,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>the exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation which ſpeaketh unto you as unto Children, my Son, deſpiſe not thou the chaſtening of the Lord, nor faint when thou art rebuked of him, for whom the Lord loveth, he chaſteneth, and ſcourgeth every Son whom he receiveth; If ye endure chaſtening, God dealeth with you as with Sons, for what Son is he whom the Father chaſteneth not? but if ye be without chaſtiſement, whereof all are partakers, then are ye Baſtards and not Sons,</hi> Heb. 12.</p>
            <p>All things work together for good to them that love God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. The Diſeaſes of the Body are the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:41646:133" rendition="simple:additions"/>of the Soul. The Aches which thou ſeeleſt in thy Body, are Inſtructions of thy Mind. God intends to make thee ſigh for thy ſins, water thy Couch with thy Tears, and abhor the remembrance of thy former miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 6. The cauſes of thy preſent pain and grief. He intends to make thee partaker of his Holineſs, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. If it pleaſe God to ſanctify his afflictions to thee, thou wilt be able to ſay with <hi>David, It was good for me that I was afflicted, that I might learn thy Commandments. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that I was afflicted I went aſtray, but now I keep thy Word,</hi> Pſal. 119.</p>
            <p>Although our Lord and Saviour was the only Son, and the beloved of the Father, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. yet he learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed obedience by the things that he ſuffered; God hath predeſtinated thee to render thee conformable to the image of his Son, that he might be the firſt-born a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt many Brethren; God intends to ſtrengthen thee with an Holy conſtancy, and to teach thee to poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs thy Soul with patience, <hi>Luk</hi> 21. He cauſeth thee therefore to learn by experience, that all Fleſh is as Graſs, and all the Glory of Man as the flower of Graſs. He intends to teach thee how to humble thy ſelf under his mighty hand, that he may lift thee up in due time, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. When God purpoſed to bring the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of <hi>Egypt, Ex.</hi> 21.5. He cauſed the yoak of their grievous bondage to be more heavy, and loded them with more unſufferable burdens. For the ſame reaſon God ſends afflictions, and gluts us with bitterneſs, becauſe he would bring us to a loathing of the World, and of its Vanities, and to think upon Heaven and its Eternal Happineſs, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. He chaſtiſeth thee that thou mayeſt not periſh with the World; He puniſheth thy Body, that thy Soul might be ſaved.</p>
            <p>As the Gold is tried in the Fire, thus the Lord caſts us into the flames of affliction, that our Faith might be tried, and appear more precious than fine Gold, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. We Glory in God, in the midſt of Tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:41646:134" rendition="simple:additions"/>knowing that Tribulation produceth Patience, Patience Experience, and Experience, Hope, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. Now Faith doth not make us aſhamed, becauſe the love of God is ſpread in our hearts, by the Holy Ghoſt, which hath been given to us. God will kindle again thy lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing Zeal, and enliven thy Prayers, that they may be more acceptable to him. Tell me not that thy di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper is an heavy burden, that hinders thy Soul from lifting it ſelf towards Heaven; and that thy grievous Aches, dry up the Humidity of thy Tongue, and cauſe thy Lips to ſtick together; for, I mean not the Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers compoſed by Art, but the Holy Affections, and earneſt Sighs of the Soul, ſent up to God. A groan of an oppreſſed Soul, and a Sigh forced from us by neceſſity, and a Tear dropt from a penitent Heart, are far more acceptable to him, than Prayers of Forty hours, that come forth of an hypocritical Mouth.</p>
            <p>When the Prophet <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaw himſelf incloſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Army, and the <hi>Red Sea,</hi> he was ſo grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouſly perplexed, that he could not open his mouth; but God heard the voice of his Heart, and anſwered to his ſilent Requeſt. King <hi>Hezekiah</hi> muttered as the Crane, or as the Swallow, and groaned as the Pidgeon; and God had a reſpect to his groaning, and tears, and heard him from his Holy Sanctuary. The ſighs of <hi>Jonas</hi> in the Whales Belly, mounted up through the waves of the Sea, and aſcended to the ſacred Habitation of God's Glory. The Cries of Jeſus dying upon the Croſs, have pierced through to the boſom of our Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Father, and have moved the Bowels of his Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Mercies. In ſhort, God ſpeaks thus of all his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, <hi>Before they cry, I will grant them their requeſt, and as they ſhall yet ſpeak, I ſhall have heard them.</hi> Therefore the Royal Prophet ſaith not only, <hi>That God hath heard the Prayers,</hi> but <hi>hath heard the deſire of the humble; thou wilt prepare their Heart, thou wilt cauſe thine Ear to hear.</hi> For that reaſon, when the Apoſtle <hi>St. Paul</hi> make;
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:41646:134" rendition="simple:additions"/>mention of that Spirit that ſupports our weakneſſes, and that teacheth us to pray, ſaith, <hi>That he crieth in our hearts Abba Father, and that he maketh requeſt for us with ſighs and groans, that cannot be uttered,</hi> Rom. 8.</p>
            <p>Take good courage, <hi>my Brother,</hi> or my <hi>Siſter,</hi> and be not frighted at the ſight of Death. Thou ſeeſt a nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row paſſage, a way all beſet with Thorns and Bryars, but it is Heavens Gate, and the way that leads to thine Heavenly Paradiſe. For we muſt of neceſſity march through a Valley of Tears, before we can enter into the City of the living God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 84. We muſt paſs through many tribulations to come to the Kingdom of Heaven, <hi>Acts</hi> 14. Bleſſed are they whom God afflicts, for they ſhall be comforted, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. Bleſſed is the man that ſuffereth temptation, for when he ſhall be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently proved, he ſhall receive the Crown of Life, which God hath promiſed to them that love him., <hi>Jam.</hi> 1. The Lord ſends thee this affliction, and this grievous temptation, not only for thine own good, and Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but alſo for the benefit of others: by his wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Wiſdom he preſerves the communion of Saints, and ſo diſpoſeth of every one, that we all contribute to the building of his Tabernacle. Upon one he beſtows Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, that he ſhould be bountiful in Alms-deeds; to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other he gives Learning, that he might inſtruct the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, and comfort the afflicted; he raiſeth others to great Honors and Dignities, that they might be able to protect the innocent, and deliver the oppreſſed; others are afflicted with deſperate evils, and grievous, and long diſeaſes; others are deprived of their moſt needful ſenſes, as of their Eye-ſight, or of their Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that they might edify their neighbors by an Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Conſtancy, and Chriſtian Patience. The Aſhes of poor <hi>Joh,</hi> have more luſter than all the Gold and the precious Stones of the World. It is many Ages ſince he endured greivous and dreadful calamities; Nevertheleſs, his patience is yet propoſed to us for our example,
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:41646:135" rendition="simple:additions"/>and to the end of the world, it will always inſtruct the Church of God; God teacheth thee by the evils which thou endureſt, to be moved with mercy and compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion towards others in the ſame condition; for as he required, that the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhould be gracious to ſtrangers, becauſe they had been ſtrangers in the Land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> Likewiſe, he ſends to thee afflictions, that thou mighteſt pity the afflicted, and ſuffer with them as Members of the ſame Myſtical Body. This appears in Jeſus Chriſt our Head, for although the chief end of his ſufferings was to redeem us, and reconcile us unto God his Father; nevertheleſs, the Holy Ghoſt informs us, That he was like unto us in all things, Sin excepted, that he might be a merciful High Prieſt, and have compaſſion of our infirmities.</p>
            <p>Finally, the affliction that grieves thee, is not only ſent to thee for thy Salvation, and for the inſtruction of thy neighbors, but alſo for the Glory of the Great and living God, who hath made and formed thee: for we may ſay of every diſeaſe that happens to good Men, as Chriſt ſaid of <hi>Lazarus</hi>'s diſtemper, <hi>This ſickneſs is not to death, but for the Glory of God, that the Son of God might be glorified by it.</hi> Thou mayeſt be ſevere to thy ſelf, but thou muſt be charitable to others, and judge diſcreetly of thy Brethren's affliction; when thou art in pain or trouble, think ſeriouſly upon thy miſcarriages, and turn unto God with all thy heart. But when thou ſeeſt others caſt upon a bed of ſickneſs, don't argue from thence, as <hi>David</hi>'s Enemies, that it is, becauſe they have committed ſome grievous crime; Rather conſider, that it may be a means which God hath a deſign to employ to declare his Power, and his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants Patience, Faith, Piety, and Vertues. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our Lord and Saviour tells the Apoſtles, when at the Sight of a Man, blind from his Birth, they enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from him, whether the Man had ſinned, or his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or Mother, becauſe he was born blind; <hi>That nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:41646:135" rendition="simple:additions"/>the Man nor his Father, nor Mother, had ſinned, but that the Works of God might be manifeſted in him,</hi> John 5. By theſe words we are not to imagine, that theſe perſons were without ſin, for there is none juſt, no not one; but we muſt underſtand that they were not guilty of any grievous ſin, and they had not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted any ſuch crime, as had drawn upon them God's vengeance from above. It was God's Will that this poor man ſhould come into the World with that natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral imperfection, that he might make him an inſtance of his Grace, and declare in him his Almighty Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: and that our Saviour, in giving him his ſight, might make it appear that he was the true God, who faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons the wonderful Eye, and that he was the true Light that enlightens every man coming into the World, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 94. <hi>John</hi> 1. Likewiſe, when ſome came to inform this Great and Wiſe Saviour, what had happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the <hi>Galileans,</hi> whoſe Bloud <hi>Pilate</hi> had mingled with their Sacrifice, he replyed in this manner, <hi>Suppoſe ye that theſe Galileans were ſinners above all the Galile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, becauſe they ſuffered ſuch things? I tell you, nay; but except ye repent, ye ſhall all likewiſe periſh: Or thoſe eighteen, upon whom the Tower in</hi> Siloam <hi>fell, and ſlew them; think ye that they were ſinners above all men that dwelt in Jeruſalem? I tell you nay, but except ye repent, ye ſhall all likewiſe periſh,</hi> Luk 13.</p>
            <p>God is glorified divers ways by the afflictions and calamities which he ſends to his Children; for firſt, he juſtifies them before all the world, from the calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies which are caſt upon them, and he diſcovers there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, to all, the ſincerity of their Love, and their unfeigned Obedience. Satan accuſeth us for ſerving God for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages which we receive in this life, <hi>Job</hi> 1. and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is pleaſed to protect and favour us by his over-ruling Providence; Therefore God removes many times from us, that which is pleaſing and delightful to the Fleſh; he gives us the Bread of Affliction for
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:41646:136" rendition="simple:additions"/>our Food, and the Waters of Sorrow for our drink; He preſents us with cups full of bitterneſs, and cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his Rod to return upon us often. By theſe grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous temptations, he ſtops the mouth of the accuſer of our Brethren, who accuſeth them day and night be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 30. He declares by that means to all the Enemies of our Salvation, and of his Glory, that we put our full confidence in God alone, and in his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable promiſes, and not in the outward tokens of his Mercy and Favor, <hi>Revel.</hi> 11. He ſhews to all the World, that the Anchor of our Hope is not fixed here below, but that it is caſt into Heaven, where Chriſt is entred as our forerunner, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.</p>
            <p>As God is glorified in our Afflictions, he is alſo ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured by our deliverance; If the Land of <hi>Judea</hi> had not been peopled with deaf, dumb, lame, blind, decre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid, and poſſeſs'd with Devils, <hi>Acts</hi> 9. If <hi>Aeneas</hi> had not been ſick eight years; If a poor Woman had not been grieved with a Bloudy Flux twelve years; If ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had not been vexed with a diſeaſe that had bend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Body; If the ſick of the Palſie had not been ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in his bed thirty eight years; If the Daughter of <hi>Jairus</hi> had not been dead; If the Widows Son of the City of <hi>Nain</hi> had not been carried to his Grave; In ſhort, If <hi>Lazarus</hi> had not been buried four days, the Glory and Divine Miracles of our Lord and Saviour had not been admired all over the World, <hi>Matth.</hi> 9. <hi>Luk</hi> 13. <hi>John</hi> 5. <hi>Matth.</hi> 9. Likewiſe our deſperate diſeaſes, and our unexpected recoveries, when humane skill can do nothing, declare to the moſt ſtupiſied Souls, that it is God alone that can give the wound, and bind it up, and that leads to the Sepulchre, and brings back again, <hi>Luk</hi> 7. <hi>John</hi> 11. <hi>Job</hi> 5. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. God's deliverances of his People from their afflictions, are of two ſorts, for either he takes away the burden from us, or elſe he ſtretcheth out to us his merciful hand, and helps us to bear it; either he removes our affliction, and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifies
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:41646:136" rendition="simple:additions"/>our grief; or he ſtrengthens us with Power and Courage, and arms us with Patience, and a generous reſolution, needful in ſuch a caſe. This appears in a notable manner in the Apoſtle <hi>St. Paul,</hi> for fear that he ſhould be lifted up in pride, becauſe of the excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of his Divine Revelations, God had given him a Thorn in the Fleſh, and had ſent the Angel of Satan to buffet him, and to increaſe the bitterneſs and ſharpneſs of his diſeaſe. This Holy man prayed often to remove it from him, but God took not this Thorn away from his Fleſh, nor did not check that meſſenger of Satan that afflicted him; but he delivered him from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniencies, in a more illuſtrious manner; for he ſtrengthened him with his Divine Spirit, and enrich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him with his Graces; he made him feel the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and Power of Chriſt within him, and accompliſh'd his Vertue in <hi>Pauls</hi> infirmity: Inſomuch, that this great Apoſtle cries out in the deepeſt of his afflictions, with tranſports of joy. <hi>I take pleaſure in infirmities, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches, in neceſſities, in perſecutions, in diſtreſſes for Chriſt's ſake, for when I am weak, then am I ſtrong, I can do all things in Chriſt that ſtrengthens me,</hi> 2 Cor. 12. This may be alſo ſeen in the Martyr <hi>St. Stephen,</hi> for he was condemned to dye by a death, the moſt painful and grievous that we can imagine; but God gave him ſuch powerful Comforts, and fill'd his mind with ſuch Joys, that his face ſhin'd as that of an Angel. You muſt underſtand the words of <hi>St. Paul</hi> in that manner, in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews, Acts</hi> 6. <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. Jeſus Chriſt having offered up Prayers and Supplications with ſtrong Crying and Tears, unto him that was able to ſave him from death, and was heard, in that he feared; for he was not altogether freed from the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings and torments of the Croſs, but he underwent it couragiouſly, and was more than Conqueror in all things; he drunk up the very dregs of the Cup of God's wrath, but by his Divine Power, he overcame
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:41646:137" rendition="simple:additions"/>the ſtrength of the poiſon; His Heavenly Father took him not down from the Croſs, nor out of the hands of his Murderers, but he hath upon this Croſs raiſed up his Glorious Trophies: the Croſs hath been as his Triumphing Chariot. Likewiſe, when you ſee a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian bear up in the midſt of a grievous affliction, and overcome his grief by his conſtancy and patience, who inſtead of murmuring, rejoyceth, and comforts him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in his diſtreſſes; you may then conclude, that ſuch an one is ſtrengthened by God's Divine Spirit, who upholds him, and accompliſheth his Heavenly Vertue, in his Servants infirmity. This is the moſt wonderful and excellent of all Deliverances.</p>
            <p>I confeſs, ſome approve this diſcourſe very well, and admit theſe Conſolations in their ordinary diſeaſes, but aſſoon as any extraordinary and violent griefs ſeize upon them, they are apt to murmure againſt God, and to complain that their puniſhment is too grievous. Some proceed further, to curſe, as <hi>Job,</hi> the day of their birth, and being hurried into deſpair, are ready to cry out with <hi>Cain,</hi> My puniſhment is greater than I am able to bear, Unhappy Man! Wilt thou imitate the barbarous Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, who curſe the Sun when it burns them, and let fly their Arrows againſt Heaven when it Thunders, wretched Man! What will it avail thee to affront thy Creator? what advantage wilt thou reap from the Blaſphemies which thou doſt belch forth againſt the Son of Righteouſneſs? miſerable Worm of the Earth, leſs than Duſt, and nothing, wilt thou undertake to contend againſt God, to pluck him from his Throne, and to break the invincible Arm of his ſtrength? Doſt thou imagine to ſtop the hand of his Vengeance, by of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending and ſinning againſt him? Wilt thou quench the fury of his wrath, by ſpitting in his Face? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveſt thou, that he will ſtretch forth his hand to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver thee, and to increaſe thy Bleſſings, whilſt thy mouth is open to blaſpheme him, who is thy Soveraign Lord.
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:41646:137" rendition="simple:additions"/>Liſten well, I beſeech thee, friend, to my advice, and I will draw thee out of the Abyſſe, where thou art un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happily fallen, and with God's help I will cauſe thee to underſtand, that thou complaineſt wrongfully againſt him, who doth all things adviſedly, and with Juſtice and Reaſon.</p>
            <p>Firſt, run over the whole courſe of thy life, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider how many wicked deeds thou haſt committed, ſome by indiſcretion, others wilfully; how many words have gone out of thy mouth, how many thoughts have been entertained in thy mind, againſt the Commands of Almighty God. Conſider ſeriouſly the number, and grievouſneſs of thy ſins and miſcarriages; and thou ſhalt find, that God's puniſhments are far leſs than thy deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings; and that for one ſenſible word and bitter pain that thou feeleſt, thou haſt deſerved many thouſands; ſo that thou ſhalt have cauſe to confeſs with the Prophet <hi>Daniel, O Lord, Righteouſneſs belongeth unto thee, but unto us confuſion of Faces,</hi> Dan. 9. And thou wilt ſay with <hi>David,</hi> Innumerable evils have compaſſed me about, mine iniquities have taken hold upon me, ſo that I am not able to look up, they are more than the hairs of my Head, therefore my heart faileth me, there is no whole part in my Fleſh, becauſe of thine indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, nor reſt in my bones, becauſe of my ſin, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 40.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Conſider how many there are in the world, more righteous than thou, who ſuffer more grievous and longer evils than thou haſt hitherto endured, and yet have not had ſo much comfort and aſſiſtance. If thou compareſt thy condition with theirs, thou ſhalt find that God ſpares and favors thee very much.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Caſt thine Eyes upon the death and paſſion of our Lord and Saviour, who being righteous and innocent, hath ſuffered for us, wicked and abominable ſinners. Thine affliction is painful, I confeſs, but that which this merciful Redeemer hath ſuffered for thee, was far more unſufferable. Let his Exclamations, his Tears,
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:41646:138" rendition="simple:additions"/>and drops of Bloud which came out of his veins, be witneſſes, and that earneſt Prayer which he repeated three times upon his bended knees, <hi>Father, if it be poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, let this cup paſs from me, that I may not drink it.</hi> Let that doleful voice upon the Croſs be alſo witneſs; <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou ſorſaken me?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. Weigh in juſt and equal Scales of the Sanctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, all the ſufferings of this life, with the torments of Hell, which thou haſt juſtly deſerved, and compare them together, thou wilt quickly conclude, that all thy pains are nothing, if compared, with the grievous tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of that lake of Fire and Brimſtone, where there are weeping and gnaſhing of Teeth. If thou art ſo ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of theſe vaniſhing pains; conſider well, how much thou art obliged to the goodneſs of God, who hath freely pardoned all thine offences, and redeemed thee from that eternal and unſpeakable Miſery of the t'o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther life,</p>
            <p n="5">5. Thou muſt imitate thoſe men, who having their Sight dimmed with the extraordinary ſplendor of bright Colours, or of a Body of Light, turn off their Eies to look upon leſs offenſive objects; inſtead of hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling always thy Wounds and Sores, inſtead of think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the afflictions that lye heavy upon thee, medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate upon the goodneſs and favors of God, vouchſaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to thee ſince thy Conception until now; I give thee leave to put in one ſide of the Scales, all thy croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, loſſes, diſeaſes, pains, and grief, upon condition, that in the t'other Balance, thou wilt put all the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, Favors, Bleſſings, and Deliverances which thou haſt received from God's liberal Hand. It is true, thou groaneſt under thy Miſery, and complaineſt of thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; thou verily believeſt that there is none ſo miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable as thou art, ſo that willingly thou wouldeſt ſay with the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah, Doth not this move ye, O ye that paſs by; behold and ſee if there be any ſorrow like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to my ſorrow, which is done unto me, wherewith the Lord
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:41646:138" rendition="simple:additions"/>hath afflicted me in the day of his fierce anger.</hi> But when there ſhould be nothing elſe but this alone, that God hath called thee to the knowledge of his Holy Will; enriched thee with the Graces of his Divine Spirit, and ſown in thy Heart the ſeeds of Eternal Life, and the bleſſed hopes of ſeeing his Face in Glory; thou oughteſt to look upon thy ſelf, as one of the happieſt Creatures under Heaven.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Finally, thou muſt meditate with a Religious at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, upon the joys of Heaven, and the Eternal Bleſſedneſs of Paradiſe, for <hi>I reckon</hi> with the Apoſtle, <hi>that the ſufferings of this preſent life, art not worthy to be eompared with the Glory which ſhall be revealed in us,</hi> Lam. 1. When we caſt our Eyes upon the Earth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, we judge it to be very ſpacious and large, our ſight is loſt in the contemplation of ſo many Provinces, Cities and Kingdoms, but when we compare it with Heaven, we find it to be but a point. Likewiſe when we look upon, and reckon up the hours, days, weeks, months, and years of our ſufferings, the time appears very tedious and long; but when we compare all theſe parcels of time with Eternity, they ſeem to us but a moment, when we ſhould have been overwhelmed with evils and miſeries, from the firſt inſtant of our entrance, into the World, until the laſt of our going out. Yet we have reaſon enough to ſay with <hi>St. Paul, Our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of Glory, while we look not at the things which are ſeen, but at the things which are not ſeen,, for the things which are ſeen are Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral, but the things which are not ſeen, are Eternal.</hi> 2 Cor. 4.</p>
            <p>The chief Spring of all our Comforts is God's Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious promiſe of ſeaſonable help in time of need; Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>print therefore in your minds theſe Divine paſſages, <hi>When he that loveth me ſhall call upon me, I will anſwer him, I will be with him in trouble, I will deliver him, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor him,</hi> Pſal. 91. <hi>The Lord delivers from all temptations,
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:41646:139" rendition="simple:additions"/>them that honor him, he is rich unto all that pray unto him.</hi> 2 Pet. 2. <hi>He is near to all them that call upon him, yea, to all them that call upon him faithfully,</hi> Rom. 10. <hi>He ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſheth the deſire of the humble, he hears their cry,</hi> Pſal. 145. <hi>The Righteous is encompaſſed with many evils, but the Lord will deliver him from them all,</hi> Pſal, 34. <hi>Call upon me in the day of thy diſtreſs, and I will deliver thee, and thou ſhalt glorify me,</hi> Pſal. 50. When a poor Subject is courted and viſited by his Prince, in the time of his ſickneſs, he looks upon it as a great favour, and an hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs indeed; And when we enjoy the preſence of a dear friend, whom we deſired to ſee in the midſt of our moſt grievous pains, we are wont to ſay, <hi>Methinks I feel no more pain, now that I have the ſatisfaction of your good company.</hi> Now the Glory of God's Majeſty, doth accompany the tenderneſs of his Love; He is the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Mercies, and the God of all comfort, who comforts us in all our afflictions. He is like that faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful friend who never forſakes us, for in our greateſt calamities, he ſuccors us, <hi>Prov.</hi> 18. He is the King of Kings, and yet our moſt cordial and ſincere friend, who frequently viſits the Houſes of ſorrow, and is near to every broken and bruiſed Heart, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34. The more we are oppreſſed with evil, the more he remembers us, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 136.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding our Childrens imperfections and miſcarriages; we cannot ſuffer to ſee them in diſtreſs, but we are moved with compaſſion, and perſwaded to help them, according to our ability, and ſhall thy God, who loves thee more ſincerely, and more cordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, than the beſt Fathers, and the moſt tender-heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Mothers do their Children, forſake thee in the day of thy diſtreſs? This Merciful and loving Father, who hath taken thee into his protection, when thou didſt enter into the World, and who ſince hath furniſhed plentifully all thy neceſſities; ſhall he deny his Gracious aſſiſtance now in the time of thy calamity? He
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:41646:139" rendition="simple:additions"/>who hath fulfilled his praiſe by thy mouth, when thou didſt yet ſuck at thy Mothers Breaſts, who hath crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thy youthful days with his Divine Bleſſings, will not forſake thee now in thine old age, he will not caſt thee off in the laſt moments of thy life, when thy ſtrength is decayed; and thou art ſcarce able to help thy ſelf,</p>
            <p>When we offer any aſſiſtance to our ſick or wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed friends, we labor to leſſen their pain; we employ all our skill, and diſcover our moſt excellent Secrets; at leaſt, we endeavour to make them ſenſible of our diſpleaſure and grief for their diſtemper by our Sighs and Tears, and by all good Offices; their complaints and outcries, are Darts that ſtrike to our very hearts; Likewiſe our merciful God is ſenſible of our calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, when he ſees us oppreſſed with grievous pains, his Bowels earn, his Heart is as it were moved, and his tender Love for us is concerned; In all our afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons he is afflicted, and whoſoever toucheth us, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the very Apple of his Eye, <hi>Hoſea</hi> 1. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 63. He is ſaid to weep and grieve at the torments that we feel, and to be ſenſible of our infirmities, <hi>Luk</hi> 2. He binds up our wounds, and poures into them his Divine balm; he cures the diſeaſed Heart, and cauſeth the bruiſed Bones to rejoyce, <hi>Job</hi> 5. He caſteth into our beds of Sickneſs, his moſt excellent Perfumes, and drives from thence all grief and diſpleaſure; when a peſtilentious Feavor hath ſeized upon you, this Heavenly Phyſitian can give you ſome Carduus Waters, powerful Antidotes to keep the poiſon from the Heart, <hi>Jer.</hi> 30. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 147. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34. <hi>Cant.</hi> 1. His Gracious Hand can drive from thy Soul the venom with which the old Serpent labors to infect it; He will in thy need, clap upon thy Head, thy Stomach, or rather to thine Heart, not a bleeding Pidgeon, but the living and cheriſhing Vertue of his Holy Spirit; only diſcover to him the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted, and diſeaſed part, or member of thy Soul or
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:41646:140" rendition="simple:additions"/>Body; and he ſhall anoint it with the Oil of Joy and Gladneſs, that ſhall run down into thy Joynts and Marrow. If thou feeleſt thy ſelf weak or fainting, ſay to him as the Spouſe in the <hi>Canticles, Comfort my Heart with wine,</hi> Chap. 2. and he will not fail to preſent unto thee of the new Wine of his Kingdom. If thou art thirſty ask him ſome drink, and he will give thee of that <hi>Water, which if a man drink, he ſhall never be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thirſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>My Brother,</hi> or <hi>My Siſter,</hi> caſt thy ſelf upon God, for his Power is as great as his Love to thee; he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands better than thou or we can, what is expedient and good for thee; in his due time he will make thy pains to ceaſe, and will pull out of thy Fleſh its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comodious Thorn; either he will drive from thee the Spirit that afflicts thee, or accompliſh his Vertue in thine Infirmity; He will ſtrengthen thee in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and with ſuch Patience, Conſtancy, and Faith, and fill thee with ſo much extraordinary joy and comfort, that every one ſhall viſibly perceive, that God himſelf is thy help, and that his Vertue ſuſtains thee. O how ſweet and pleaſant is God's aſſiſtance to a Chriſtian Soul; it brings along with it ſo much pleaſure, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable delight; it cauſeth ſuch undeniable teſtimonies of our Predeſtination to appear; it gives us ſo many rare fore-taſts of our Celeſtial Inheritance, that <hi>St. Paul</hi> doth not only prefer it to all the Pleaſures and Honors of the World, but he prefers it alſo to his being raviſh'd into the third Heaven, and to his ſeeing unſpeakable things which cannot be uttered, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.</p>
            <p>If Afflictions are increas'd with Chriſt, Joy and Comfort increaſe alſo with him; for as God commands Wine to be given to a Man whoſe Heart is oppreſſed with ſorrow, to drive away his ſadneſs, and bury his troubled thoughts in oblivion. Thus in the greateſt evils, God ſupplieth us with the ſtrongeſt and moſt cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial Conſolations. It is in this occaſion that he declares
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:41646:140" rendition="simple:additions"/>his greateſt Power, and pours out moſt plentifully his Divine Graces, <hi>Iſ.</hi> 4. When thou ſhouldeſt walk through the Flames, the Fire ſhall not burn, nor touch thee; for as the Son of God was in the Furnace with <hi>Daniels</hi> three Companions in <hi>Babylon;</hi> Thus in thy moſt violent fits of the Feaver, in the midſt of thy moſt grievous aches, he will ſatiate thy Soul, and thou ſhalt be like a watered Garden, <hi>Dan.</hi> 5. Or as a living Spring of Comfort, that can never be ſtopt, nor dried up. Let the Storms and Flouds beat againſt thee; Let the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluxions endeavour to check thee, <hi>Iſ.</hi> 58. thou mayeſt ſay with King <hi>David, I have ſet the Lord always before me, becauſe he is at my right hand, I ſhall not be moved,</hi> Pſal. 16. When I ſhould walk in the valley of the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of Death, when I ſhould have no other help nor aſſiſtance in the World, when there ſhould be no more ſtrength remain in my Body, I would not fear; for, <hi>O God, thy ſtaff, and thy Rod will comfort me,</hi> Iſ. 26. God will not only draw near to thy bed of Sickneſs, but he will embrace and receive thee into his protection, he will kiſs thee with the kiſſes of his mouth, and make thee taſte of the ſweetneſs of his Divine Comforts, <hi>Cant.</hi> 1. He will cheriſh thee as a Mother doth her Child, to paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy it, and make thee ſo ſenſible of his Love, that thou mayeſt ſay with the Spouſe, <hi>his left hand is under my head, and his right doth embrace me.</hi> With his Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Hand he will wipe off thy cold ſweat, and into his boſom he will receive thy ſighs; thy groans, and thy tears, he will gather up into his moſt precious bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles. And as it happened when our Lord and Saviour was in his Agony, when drops of Bloud fell from him, the Holy Angels appeared to comfort him, <hi>Luk</hi> 22. Likewiſe, in our greateſt and moſt difficult encounters, when thou ſhalt be at handy-blows with death it ſelf, his faithful Miniſters, h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="288" facs="tcp:41646:141" rendition="simple:additions"/>theſe earthly Comforters ſhall fail, he will ſend to thee ſome of thoſe powerful Spirits, that wait before his Glorious Throne, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. O good God, if we could but perceive the things that are of themſelves inviſible, and if thou didſt but give us eyes, like unto thoſe of the Holy Prophet, we ſhould behold Legions of immortal Spirits, flying about in the houſes of Sorrow, with an intent to comfort the Chriſtian Souls, <hi>Iſ.</hi> 6. 2 <hi>King.</hi> 6. Finally, as the Sun with its Light, and the ſtrength of its Beams, drives away the thickeſt Clouds, and comforts, with its delightful countenance, the face of the whole Earth; Thus Jeſus Chriſt the Sun of Righteouſneſs, that carries healing under his wings, baniſheth all ſadneſs with the light of his Divine Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. and with the preſence of his Holy Spirit, he drives away the moſt ſenſible griefs, and fills us with unſpeakable joy, and with the Peace of God which paſſeth all underſtanding.</p>

I beſeech thee, my God, if thou doſt not remove the diſtemper of my Body, at leaſt, pluck out of my Heart and mind, all the grief and diſpleaſure, that torments me; Fill my Soul with thy Peace, Joy, Love, and Heavenly Comforts, while my Body languiſheth upon this Earth, and while I am kept from my former ſocieties of Men. Let my mind be lifted up to Heaven. Let my Soul delight it ſelf in a familiarity with thee; I have loſt too much time alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy about the affairs of the World, that is nothing but vanity and vexation of Spirit. Give me Grace to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy now theſe few moments of leaſure, which thou doſt grant to me, to think ſeriouſly upon my ſins, to beg thy pardon with an earneſt Repentance. Give me Grace to meditate upon thine unſpeakable and eternal Mercy, to embrace it with a true and lively Faith, upon thy Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and the Happineſs of thy Kingdom, that I may la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor to attain unto it with tranſports of joy; ſo that I may ſay with the Prophet</hi> David, My Soul ſhall be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, as with Marrow and Fatneſs, and my Mouth ſhall praiſe thee with joyful Lips; when I remember thee upon my Bed, and meditate on thee in the night Watches. <hi>My Sickneſs ſeems very tedious; but alas, Lord, my Sins have continued longer, and all this pain that afflicts me, and forceth from me ſo many ſighs, is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in compariſon of the advantages and happineſs, that waits for me in Heaven. When the whole courſe of my life ſhould be a continual languiſhing, it is but a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

O Lord, Let the diſtempers and pains of my Body, turn to the health of my Soul, and a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful obligation, to the Practice of Piety, and of all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Vertues. Let me learn thereby to renounce the World, and deny my ſelf, and to caſt my ſelf wholly into thy Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Hands, and ſubmit my ſelf to thy Holy Will. As Jeſus Chriſt is gain to me, whether I live, or whether I dye, give me Grace to be ready to praiſe and glorify thy Mercy, both in Life or Death.

               <head>A Prayer and Meditation for a ſick Perſon tormented with grievous pains.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>O Father of Mercies, and God of all Comfort, have pity upon me, thou knoweſt that I am vexed with fearful pains, that diſturb my Mind, and torment my Body; thine Arrows run through me on every ſide, and my Soul hath its fill of bitterneſs. Thy wrath hath torn me to pieces, and thou ſeemeſt to have ſet thy ſelf againſt me. One depth calls for another. At thy Command, the Waves and Flouds have paſſed over my head; Thou haſt gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven me many days of affliction, and nights of torment; I am like a perſon breaking upon a wheel, or burning in hot flames; I feel a fire that conſumes me as a Worm that gnaws, and darts that pierce through my Heart. Sure my ſins muſt be abominable and grievous, ſeeing thou infflicteſt this great puniſhment upon me, for thou art Mercy it ſelf, and it is not willingly that thou afflicteſt the Sons of Men. O good God, conſider what thou art, and what I am; wilt thou ſtretch forth thine invincible Arm againſt the Leaf that the wind toſſeth up and down? wilt thou declare the fierceneſs of thine Eternal diſpleaſure, againſt Chaff and Stubble? wilt thou let fly all thine Arrows againſt a wretched Worm of the Earth? and wilt thou caſt out all thy Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbolts againſt a little Duſt? O Great God, I am not a worthy Object of thy wrath, againſt which thou ſhouldeſt kindle all thy diſpleaſure Remember that I am but fleſh, a Wind that paſſeth away and returneth not again; but rather remember Lord, that I am thy Child, and that thou haſt redeemed me with the Bloud of thine only Son. O my God, it is not poſſible for me to withold my complaints, ſuppreſs my groans, and to dry up this torrent of Tears; my Soul is wearied out with this languiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing life, or rather with this unmerciful Death: for is
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:41646:143"/>there any ſorrow like unto my ſorrow? Is there any torture or pain like unto my torment? When the Prophet</hi> Jonas <hi>ſaw a little Goard withered, that afforded him before a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable ſhelter and ſhadow from the Sun-beams, when he felt them beating hot upon his Head, he cried out,</hi> Death is better to me than life. <hi>How much more cauſe have I to ſpeak in this manner; I, of whom the ſtrengh is withered as the parched Ground in the midſt of Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer; I, who feel a Fire in my Bones, and an Heat in my Bowels, that burns and conſumes me by day and by night; Shall not thine Almighty and Merciful Hand, that hath freed me from Hell, take me out alſo of this deep Abyſſe of Miſery? Thou, who delivereſt thy Children from the burning Furnace, wilt thou not quench the fury of this Flame that devours me? O Lord, ſhut up my Lips, and let there come out nothing repugnant to that reſpect that I owe to thy Divine Majeſty. To thee, Great God, belongs Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, but to me, ſhame and confuſion of face; when thou ſhouldeſt cauſe me to endure a thouſand Plagues and Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments more, if this poor Body were able to ſuffer them; and when thou ſhouldeſt caſt me irrecoverably into the Lake that burns with Fire and Brimſtone, I ſhould have no cauſe to complain of thy ſeverity. It is true, my pains are great, but they are nothing in compariſon of my ſins and offences; my torments are violent, but they are not to be compared with my Saviours bitter ſufferings, with that cold ſweat, and thoſe drops of Bloud that fell from his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Body: My affliction is unmerciful, but it is not to be compared with the Glory, that ſhall be revealed in them that worſhip thee, and perſevere to the end, in an obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to thy Holy Will. When thou ſhouldeſt kill me, Lord, yet would I hope in thee, for thou afflicteſt me, that I might not periſh for ever, with the reſt of the World; Thou cauſeſt my Body to be deſtroyed, that my Soul might be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. Bruiſe me, Lord, and cruſh me to pieces, ſo that I may become ſome of thy precious Wheat; Cut and burn me in this momentary Life, ſo that thou wilt be favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:41646:144"/>to me in the life to come. Cauſe this bitter cup to paſs from me, that I may not drink up all its dregs. Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, O Heavenly Father, not my Will, but thy Will be done. Pluck this Thorn out of my Fleſh, or vouchſafe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me ſufficient ſtrength to endure its deadly wounds with patience. O good God, thou knoweſt that my Spirit is wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, but my Fleſh is weak, and that my miſery is heavier than the Sand of the Sea-ſhore; but thou that quickeneſt the dead, wilt accompliſh thy Vertue in mine Infirmities; Therefore, inſtead of ſpeaking in</hi> Cain's <hi>Language,</hi> My puniſhment is greater than I can bear. <hi>I will ſay with</hi> St. Paul, I can do all things in Chriſt that ſtrengthens me. <hi>O Lord, puniſh me not in thy wrath, nor correct me in thy heavy diſpleaſure, but chaſtiſe me in reaſon, that I may not be reduced to nothing. When thou didſt wreſtle with</hi> Jacob, <hi>thou tookeſt upon thee an Humane Body, and didſt ſtrengthen thy Servant by the vertue of thy Divine Spirit. O Merciful and Graciouus God, let thy puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments be proportionable to my great weakneſſes; ſuffer not any temptation to ſeize upon me, but only Humane, and give me, with the temptation, an happy iſſue, that I may ſupport it, that neither Death nor Life, nor Pain nor Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, may ever ſeparate me from thy Love, or pluck me out of thine Hand. Good Lord, forſake me not, that I may never forſake thee, but, enable me with Strength, Patience, and Conſtancy, to bear my burden, and make me more than Conqueror, by Jeſus Chriſt our Lord. Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful God, pity thy ſervant; or rather thine adopted Child. Awaken thy jealouſie, and let thy Bowels that are har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened againſt me, move thee to compaſſion, Strengthen me in this encounter with the aſſiſtance of the good Angels that comforted thine only Son, in the night of his moſt bitter af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction cauſe this black night of my Sorrows to paſs ſpeedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly away, or rather in the midſt of theſe dark ſhadows, cauſe me to ſee the raviſhing beams of thy Mercy. Heal my grievous wounds, or elſe pour into them the refreſhing Balm of thy moſt tender and Divine Conſolations; my
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:41646:144" rendition="simple:additions"/>Heart and my Fleſh fail, and faint away, but look upon me with a Gracious Eye, and receive me into the embraces of thine Eternal Mercy. Declare, I beſeech thee, how ſenſible thou art of my affliction, by a preſent relief, receive my Sweat and Tears, and put them into thy Bottles. O good God, thou ſeeſt that I am fainting, and that my Soul is weary within me, comfort me therefore with thy Cordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, and with thy moſt Divine refreſhments; Give me to drink of the Wine of thy moſt effectual Conſolations, that may reſtore unto me my ſpirits, apply the right hand of thy Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, that it may ſtrengthen my Soul, and drive from thence all poiſon and infection. Let thine Holy Spirit, the Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Dove light upon me, to bring joy unto me. O living God, thou ſeeſt that I dye, but give me ſome of that li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Water, whereof if a man drink, he ſhall live Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally; my Friends are grieved with me, and weep for my bitter affliction, but can give me no aſſiſtance, but thine only look would be able to deliver me. O my God, either pull me out of this Sea of Trouble, into which thou haſt caſt me, or cauſe me to paſs through theſe waves, to the Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance prepared for me from the foundation of the World. Quench theſe violent Flames that burn and conſume me, or let them ſerve as fiery Chariots, to carry me in triumph to Heaven. O how mad and ſenſeleſs ſhould I be, if I did fear Death, ſeeing that it will put an end to my tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, it will break in pieces my grievous Chains; it will wipe away all Tears from mine Eyes, and baniſh all grief from my Heart. O my God, when ſhall all my Cries, my Sighs, and Groans, be changed into Songs of Praiſe, and Thanksgiving? when ſhall I ſee my ſelf in the Glorious com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of the Bleſſed, who are come out of the great tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and who have waſh'd and cleanſed their Garments in the Bloud of the Lamb.

                  <hi>The ſecond Conſolation againſt the fears of Death, is to look upon God as a merciful Father, and to truſt upon his infinite Goodneſs.</hi>
               </p>
            </argument>
            <p>THere is no Child well deſcended, but deſires earneſtly to ſee his Fathers Face, and eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, the Face of a Good and Gracious Father. A great Princes Son, who hath been brought up in a Forreign Countrey, rejoyceth at his own Happineſs, when his Father ſends for him, to make him parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of the Glory and Dignity of his Empire, he is not then grieved nor troubled, he ſeeks not to delay his going, but rather he embraceth, with tranſports of joy, the Meſſenger of ſuch good news; he thinks of nothing but of haſting his departure; if he could bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row wings, he would fly with an unſpeakable ſwift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to his Fathers Palace, Now we are the Children of the Great God, whoſe Throne is Heaven, and whoſe Footſtool is the Earth; for our Faith that looks upon Jeſus Chriſt as our Saviour and Redeemer, conſiders God as our God and Father, for to them who have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived this only Son of the Father, hath been grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the priviledge of being the Sons of God, to them who believe in his name, 1 <hi>Job.</hi> 1. So that we have juſt cauſe to be tranſported in an Holy Exceſs of Joy, with the Apoſtle <hi>St. John, Behold what manner of love the Father hath beſtowed upon us, that we ſhould be called the Sons of God,</hi> 1 Joh. 3.</p>
            <p>We were by nature Children of Wrath, as others, but God, who is rich in Mercy, hath predeſtinated us unto the adoption of Children by Jeſus Chriſt to himſelf, according to the good pleaſure of his Will, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. He gives us the Gracious aſſurances of this free adoption,
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:41646:145" rendition="simple:additions"/>in this life; for as we are Children, he hath ſent the Spirit of his Son in our Hearts, to cry <hi>Abba, Father, Eph.</hi> 1. This Holy Spirit bears witneſs with our Spirits, that we are the Children of God, If we be Children, then Heirs of God, and Co-heirs with Chriſt, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. Yea, if we ſuffer with him, that we may be alſo Glorified with him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. That we might be the Children of God; he hath not only adopted us by Jeſus Chriſt, but alſo regenerated us by uncorruptible Seed. We are not born of Fleſh and of Bloud, but we are born of God. His infinite Goodneſs perſwaded him firſt, to grant us a Being, and his incomprehenſible love, hath moved him to reform our Beings, and reprint his Divine Image in our Hearts, <hi>John</hi> 1. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. He hath begotten us by his pure Grace, by the word of his Truth. that we might be the Firſt Fruits of his Creatures, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1. <hi>Bleſſed be the God and Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his abundant Mercy, hath begotten us again un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a lively hope, by the reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt from the dead, to an inheritance uncorruptible, and undefiled, and that fadeth not away, reſerved in Heaven for us,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.</p>
            <p>Now although we be the Children of God, and the ſuppoſed Heirs of his Crown, our Glory and Dignity is not to be diſcerned during the years of our Earthly Pilgrimage. Our Heavenly Father ſuffers us here in an Eſtate contemptible in the eye of the World, that we might learn Humility, and deſire more earneſtly his celeſtial Inheritance. As it happens in a dark and obſcure midnight, Men tread under feet the Pearls, the Diamonds, the Scepters, and the Crowns; Thus it is now, that a groſs ignorance hath overſpread and covers the face of the World, the Children of God, who are the moſt precious Jewels of his Crown, are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem'd no better than the ſcum, or the filth of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Earth. This conſideration cauſeth <hi>St. John</hi> to tell us, <hi>Beloved, we are now Children of God, it doth not yet ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear what we ſhall be; but we know, that when he ſhall
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:41646:146" rendition="simple:additions"/>appear, we ſhall be like him, for we ſhall ſee him as he is,</hi> 1 Joh. 3. As <hi>David</hi> ſent for <hi>Abſalom</hi> out of the <hi>Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtins</hi> Countrey, and gave him leave to dwell in the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> but for the ſpace of two years, he would not ſuffer him to enter his Royal Palace, or ſee his Face; Likewiſe, God hath freed us from the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils Tyranny, and Hells Power, he hath admitted us into his Holy Church, which is as his <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> where he gives a fore-taſt of our Heavenly Peace and Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation, but he delays for a time our reception into the magnificent Palace of his Glory, and to the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Divine Preſence, the higheſt ſatisfaction, and the greateſt happineſs. While we remain in the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, we are eſtranged from God, ſo that we are ſaved, but by Hope, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. But when we ſhall depart out of this Body, we ſhall be with the Lord, and ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into a real fruition of his Celeſtial Inheritance, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. Finally, while we dwell here below, we may ſee the Image of our Heavenly Father, and behold his Face as in a Glaſs, but when he ſhall have cauſed us to draw near his Throne, we ſhall ſee him face to face, we ſhall be transformed into his likeneſs, and be fully ſatisfied with his reſemblance, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 17.</p>
            <p>Let Death be never ſo hideous and ugly, it is the Meſſenger of our Heavenly Father, and if we can have but the confidence to open its iron hands, and look into them, we ſhall find Gracious Letters, full of Love, by which this Father of Mercy calls us, to the full enjoyment of our Eternal Happineſs. Death doth not only invite us to go to God, but it ſerves as a Veſſel to convey us through this tempeſtuous Sea of the World, to go to our good God, who expects our coming at the Haven of everlaſting Reſt; it is like to <hi>Eliah</hi>'s Chariot of Fire, that carried him up to Heaven, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 2. If Death covers our eyes with one hand, and deprives us of the Light of the Sun with the other
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:41646:146" rendition="simple:additions"/>it rents in pieces that Vail which hinders us from the ſight of the varieties of God's immortal Sanctuary, and diſcovers to us the Glorious Face of the Father of Lights; with the one it digs for our Bodies a Grave to caſt them in, but with the other hand it flings open, for our Souls, the Gates of the Heavenly <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> to uſher them into the Banqueting-Hall.</p>
            <p>Therefore Death ſhould be ſo far from frighting us, that its arrival ſhould rather comfort us, and cauſe us to reſolve to follow it with an Holy chearfulneſs, for we ſhould not only be willing to go to God with tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports of joy, when he is pleaſed to call us to himſelf, to behold his Face, and to eat of the Bread of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life, in his Heavenly Kingdom, but, of our own accord, we ſhould be impatient to enjoy his Glorious Preſence, and in a continual longing, to ſee that happy day that ſhall bring us into him, and ſatisfy us with his unſpeakable Delights. A true Chriſtian ſhould be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in this occaſion, with <hi>David</hi>'s Spirit. <hi>As the Hart panteth after the Water-Brooks, ſo panteth my Soul after thee, O God. My Soul thirſteth for God, for the living God, when ſhall I come and appear before God?</hi>

            <p>I confeſs that this Great God, before whom we are to appear, is cloathed with Glory and Majeſty, and dwels in the Light, which no man can approach unto; 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. I know that he ſits upon a dreadful Throne of Fire, whereof the Wheels are like a burning Flame, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. that a thouſand thouſand wait upon him, and ten thouſand Millions ſtand before him, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 6. I am not ignorant, that at his Preſence the Earth is moved, the Sea and the Rivers dry up, the Mountains tremble, and the little Hills ſhake, the Rocks decay, the Pillars of Heaven fail, and the Seraphims cover themſelves with their wings, <hi>Revel.</hi> 4. But let not this dreadful Majeſty and Heavenly Pomp, terrify thee, O believing, Soul, for this Great God is full of a Fatherly affection for thee. Round about this Throne of God there is a
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:41646:147" rendition="simple:additions"/>beautiful Rainbow of a Green colour, like unto an Emerald, to ſignify unto us, that God is reconciled, and that the Covenant of our Peace is to continue for ever. As out of this magnificent Throne, proceed the Thunders and Thunderbolts, that fright the World<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, and caſt the proud Souls down to the ground; ſo from thence proceed alſo Lightnings, and ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhing Flames, as are able to comfort the Believer, and to guide him to his Celeſtial Inheritance. We are related to God more than the Angels and Seraphims, for we are not only his Creatures and Servants, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo his Children, and the Members of his Son; nay, we are but one with him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. Let us therefore return our hearty thanks to our Heavenly Father, which hath made us mete to be partakers of the Inheritance of the Saints in Light, <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 1.</p>
            <p>Let us go up with confidence to Mount <hi>Sion,</hi> for there are no ſignes of God's wrath to be ſeen, nor of his juſt vengeance; we ſhall find no bounds to ſeparate us from God's Gracious Preſence but we ſhall find Cords of Love to draw us, and unite us unto him; we ſhall ſee no fire to devour and ſcare us, but we ſhall perceive the comfortable Flames which burn with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out conſuming, and which bring Comfort rather than Fear; we ſhall not meet there a terrible Law-giver to derive us from him, to ſcare us with his Thunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolts; but we ſhall meet a loving Father to embrace us, and open to us the boſom of his tender compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. In ſhort, we ſhall not hear there the terrible ſound of the Trumpet, that cauſeth the Rocks to ſplit aſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that caſts to the ground the proud Cedars, and that makes the Deer caſt their young; but we ſhall hear the ſweet and melodious voice, that will ſettle our trembling Souls, refreſh our languiſhing Hopes, and fill us with Peace, and Eternal Comfort, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.</p>
            <p>I acknowledge that God is juſt, but he is alſo mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful, and his Mercy rejoyceth againſt Judgement; his
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:41646:147" rendition="simple:additions"/>Juſtice is like an exceeding high Mountain, but his Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy may be compared to the bottomleſs deep, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 39. Therefore <hi>Moſes</hi> who had ſeen God more than any living Man, cannot be ſatisfied, to extol and magnify his infinite Mercy, and the overflowing Riches of his love, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 36. He names him but once, <hi>Juſt,</hi> but many times he calls him <hi>Merciful, Gracious, Long ſuffering, abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant in Goodneſs, and Truth,</hi> Exod. 4. It is not unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of our obſervation, that the word <hi>Righteous</hi> or <hi>Juſt,</hi> attributed to God, doth often ſignify alſo <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful, Gracious,</hi> and <hi>Loving,</hi> in the Holy Tongue. It is true, God holds in his hand the ſword of his Juſtice, but he is girded, and cloathed with his Mercy, as with a Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. In ſhort, God is not only Good and Merciful, but he is alſo Goodneſs and Mercy it ſelf, 1 <hi>John</hi> 4. His compaſſion and tenderneſs is far greater than that of the beſt Fathers or Mothers, as he himſelf declares by the Prophet, <hi>Can a Woman forget her Sucking-Child, that ſhe ſhould not have compaſſion on the Son of her Womb; yea, they may forget, yet will not I forget thee: Behold, I have graven thee upon the palms of my Hands, yea, in the bottom of my Heart,</hi> Iſ. 49. Theſe fatherly Compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions force him to let fall the ſword of his juſtice, as he tells us in <hi>Hoſea, How ſhall I make thee as</hi> Admah? <hi>how ſhall I ſet thee as</hi> Zeboim? <hi>mine heart is turned within me, my repentings are kindled together, I will not execute the fierceneſs of mine anger,</hi> Chap. 11. Therefore <hi>David</hi> had good cauſe to be perſwaded, <hi>That when his Father and Mother ſhould forſake him, the Lord would receive him.</hi> When all Love, Kindneſs, and Mercy were totally ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed from the Earth; when all natural affections ſhould be extinct, my God will not forſake me, while I live, and at the hour of my death, he will receive me into his boſom, and cover me with his wings. Chriſtian Souls, Let not the ſad remembrance of your former ſins and miſcarriages, diſcourage you; for when we appear before the Throne of Gods Majeſty; we
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:41646:148" rendition="simple:additions"/>muſt not truſt upon our own Righteouſneſs, nor be puſt up with the fancy of our merits; but we muſt place all our aſſurance and hope, in the Mercy of God alone; we muſt imitate <hi>Daniel,</hi> who ſpeaks thus of himſelf, and of his proceedings, <hi>We do not preſent our ſupplications before thee for our Righteouſneſſes, but for thy great Mercies,</hi> Dan 9. The compaſſions of God are our Mercies, while God hath ſtore of compaſſions, we ſhall not want merits, <hi>St. Bern.</hi> Now God's Mercies and Compaſſions can never fail; they renew every morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, his faithfulneſs is very excellent, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3. As I live, ſaith the Lord God, I have no pleaſure in the death of the wicked, but that the wicked turn from his way and live, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33. <hi>I am he, I am he that blots out all thy ſins for mine own ſake, and will not remember thy tranſgreſſions,</hi> Iſai. 45. Although our ſins and iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties appear to us with all the deformity and uglineſs of Hell; Be not overcome with grief, nor caſt your ſelves into deſpair; Let us rather ſay with the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Jeremiah, Wherefore doth a living man complain, a man for the puniſhment of his ſins; Let us ſearch and try our ways, and turn again to the Lord. Let us lift up our Heart with our Hands unto God in the Heavens.</hi> Or let us ſpeak in the language of <hi>Micah, Who is a God like unto thee, that pardoneth iniquity, and paſſeth by the tranſgreſſions of the remnant of his Heritage? he retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not his anger for ever, becauſe he delighteth in Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. He will come again, he will have compaſſion upon us, he will ſubdue our iniquities, and thou wilt caſt out their ſins into the depths of the Sea,</hi> Micah 7. Let us comfort our ſelves with the words of the Prophet <hi>Daniel, To the Lord our God belongs Mercies and Forgiveneſſes, though we have rebelled againſt him,</hi> Dan. 7.</p>
            <p>Tell me not again, I know that God is Good and Merciful, but I have offended him too much, to believe that he will vouchſafe me a Pardon, and have Mercy upon me. After many repented Vows, after many
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:41646:148" rendition="simple:additions"/>Groans, Sighs, and Tears of Repentance. I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned as the Dog to his Vomit, and as the Swine to wallow in the Mire, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. But wretched ſinner, learn for thy comfort, that when thy ſins ſhould be as many as the Sand of the Sea-ſhore, or as the Stars of the Sky, <hi>Iſ.</hi> 44. If thou doſt now ſincerely repent of them, with a contrite Soul, God will blot them out as the Cloud, and will caſt them into the Sea; for God's Mercy hath no bounds, and his Compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are infinite, <hi>Micah</hi> 7. When thy Brother hath of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended thee, if he aske forgiveneſs, the Lord Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands that thou ſhouldeſt pardon him, not only ſeven times, but ſeventy and ſeven times, <hi>Matth.</hi> 17. How much more reaſon haſt thou to believe, that God, of his infinite Goodneſs and Mercy, will pardon thee more ſins, and oftener; therefore inſtead of murmur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over thy miſcarriages, accept of the precious Balm of his Divine Conſolations, and ſay with the Royal Prophet, <hi>Bleſs the Lord, O my ſoul, and all that is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in me, bleſs his Holy Name; Bleſs the Lord O my Soul, and forget not all his benefits, who forgiveth all thine iniquities, who healeth all thy diſeaſes, who redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth thy life from deſtruction; who crowneth thee with loving kindneſſes and tender mercies, who ſatisfieth thy mouth with good things, ſo that thy youth is renewed, like the Eagles. The Lord executeth Righteouſneſs and Judgement, for all that are oppreſſed; the Lord is merciful and gracious, ſlow to anger and plenteous in mercy. He will not always chide, neither will he keep his anger for ever; he hath not dealt with us after our ſins, nor rewarded us according to our iniquities; for a the Heaven is high above the Earth, ſo great is his mercy towards them that fear him, as far as the Eaſt is from the Weſt, ſo far hath he removed our tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions from us. Like as a Father pitieth his Children, ſo the Lord pitieth them that fear him,</hi> Pſal. 103.</p>
            <p>Don't anſwer me, that your ſins are ſo grievous and abominable, that you cannot expect a Pardon, for
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:41646:149" rendition="simple:additions"/>when they ſhould be as high as the proudeſt Mountains, if thou art really ſenſible of their weight, if they make thee to ſigh and groan, God's infinite Mercy, like a Deluge, ſhall cover and waſh them away, <hi>Lam.</hi> 5. or like a Torrent, it ſhall tranſport them out of his ſight<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for when ſin abounds, God's Grace will ſuper-abound, in caſe there be true Repentance, <hi>Iſ.</hi> 1 When your ſins ſhould be as Scarlet, they ſhall be as white as Snow, when they ſhould be as red as Vermilion, they ſhall become as white as Wooll. All the offences that you are guilty of ſince you are in the World, are finite, and limited, but God's Mercy is infinite. <hi>O Lord, if thou ſhouldeſt mark iniquities who ſhall ſtand, but there is forgiveneſs with thee, that thou mayeſt be feared,</hi> Pſal. 130.</p>
            <p>He that hides his tranſgreſſions ſhall not proſper, but he that confeſſeth and forſaketh them, ſhall obtain Mercy, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.8. It is certain that there is no ſinner ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo guilty, that ſhall ſeek unto God's Mercy, by a true Repentance, but ſhall obtain his Requeſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 113. <hi>David</hi> had defiled himſelf with an horrible Adultery, and imbrued his Hands in the Bloud of one of his moſt faithful Servants; but aſſoon as he made his Suit unto God, with a broken Heart, and a contrite Spirit, this good and merciful Creator cleanſed this foul Sinner from all his guilt, at the fountain of his infinite Mercy; he made him whiter than Snow, and comforted his bruiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Bones. This conſideration cauſed him to cry out, <hi>I ſaid I will confeſs unto God my tranſgreſſions, and thou O God, haſt taken away the puniſhment of my ſin,</hi> Pſ. 52, King <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> had been addicted to deviliſh Arts, and to the moſt abominablee and grievous Idolatries, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 33. Nevertheleſs, as ſoon as he ſighs in his Chains, his Prayers and his Groans found a Gracious reception at the Throne of Grace. The poor Publican in the Gospel being aſhamed to lift up his Eyes to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, ſtruck upon his Breaſt with this expreſſion of his penitent Soul, <hi>O God be merciful to me a ſinner,</hi> Luk 18.
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:41646:149" rendition="simple:additions"/>And God look'd upon him with an Eye of Mercy, and ſtretched out unto him his Gracious Hand, ſo that h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> departed to his home juſtified. The penitent <hi>Magdalen</hi> was inwardly grieved at her former filthy and debauch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed behaviour, ſo that ſhe came and caſt her ſelf at our Saviours Feet, watering them with her Tears, and wiping them with the Hair of her Head, <hi>Luk</hi> 9. but Chriſt ſoon lifted her up with theſe comfortable words, <hi>Thy ſins are pardoned, thy faith hath ſaved thee, go in peace. St. Peter</hi> by an unconſtancy, that ſhould cauſe the beſt Chriſtians to tremble for fear of falling into the ſame Apoſtacy, denied his Lord and Maſter three times, with curſing and ſwearing, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. but this mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful God looked upon him with an eye of compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and gave him grace to repent moſt bitterly, of ſuch a foul crime. I doubt not, but at the ſame time, that this wretched ſinner poured forth his Tears in God's preſence; doubtleſs, he poured into his Heart the Oyl of Joy and Gladneſs, and comforted him moſt effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, by his Divine Spirit. Likewiſe, although your ſins be grievous and abominable, if your Souls be ſtruck with grief and diſpleaſure, if your Hearts be truly pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent, ſo that you ſhed ſincere Tears of Repentance; and in caſe you are heartily ſorry for the want of a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient diſpleaſure for your ſins, in caſe you proſtrate your ſelf before your Heavenly Father, he will raiſe you up again by his infinite Goodneſs, he will caſt all your ſins and tranſgreſſions behind him; he will cry unto you in your Hearts, by the voice of his Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, <hi>My Son,</hi> or, <hi>My Daughter, thy ſins are forgiven thee,</hi> John 5. He will fill your Souls with an unſpeakable Joy, <hi>Luk</hi> 9. and will cauſe you to ſing with the <hi>Pſalmiſt, Bleſſed is he whoſe tranſgreſſion is forgiven, whoſe ſin is co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered. Bleſſed is the man unto whom the Lord imputeth not iniquity, and in whoſe ſpirit there is no guile.</hi> Pſal. 32. Finally, think not that it is ever too late to repent, and that when Death is upon your Lips, it is no time to
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:41646:150" rendition="simple:additions"/>ſeek to the Mercy of God. As the buſineſs of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance cannot be too ſoon, becauſe we know not when God will call us to himſelf; It is moſt certain, that it can never be too late; for at what time or ſeaſon ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the poor ſinner melts into Tears of Repentance, in caſe his Repentance be real, and his Tears proceed from a penitent heart; God will always have the Arms of his Mercy wide open to receive him. The Thief crucified at our Saviours ſide, was at the laſt gasp, when he was converted, and when he uttered this excellent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion; <hi>Remember me Lord, when thou comeſt into thy Kingdom,</hi> Luk 23. Our good and merciful Saviour, grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Requeſt, and encouraged him with the moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and comfortable promiſe that we can imagine; <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily I ſay unto thee, To day ſhalt thou be with me in</hi> Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe. In like manner, when thou art at the point of death, if God ſpeaks unto thee, and awakens thy Conſcience; it is an infallible ſigne, that he hath compaſſion upon thee, and that he will not deſtroy thee. It is a ſigne that he opens for thee his Heaven, full of Light and Glory, and offers unto thee his Paradice, with all its Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Excellencies. Doubt not, penitent ſinner, that this is the acceptable day, the day of Salvation, and the time of Gods good pleaſure; ſeeing that this good God draws ſo near thee, thou mayeſt with freedom draw near him. And ſeeing that he beats and knocks at the door of thine Heart; it is an infallible token, that thou mayeſt alſo beat at the door of his Eternal Mercies, and that he intends to open, to ſatisfy thee. In ſhort, at what hour ſoever we go unto God, and appear before his Throne; he ſtretcheth out unto us the Golden Scepter of his Goodneſs, that we ſhould obtain Mercy, and find Grace, to be helped in time of need.</p>
            <p>It is not needful that we ſhould prepare long and ela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borated Speeches or Prayers, to perſwade God to vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe his Grace and needful help, in ſuch an urgent ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity. It is not neceſſary that we ſhould compoſe them,
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:41646:150" rendition="simple:additions"/>with the Art and Induſtry of humane Wiſdom. We need but pray unto God, as unto our Father, and weep in his boſom; we need but open unto him our Hearts, and call our ſelves his Children; that alone, is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to move him to compaſſion, and to ſtir up his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly affections, to appeaſe his anger, and to draw up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us his moſt excellent Bleſſings. The Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> the moſt Eloquent of the Men of his time, ſeeks no other argument to perſwade God to have Mercy and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion but this, <hi>Look down from Heaven, and behold from the Habitation of thy Holineſs, and of thy Glory; where is thy Zeal and thy Strength, the ſounding of thy Bowels, and of thy Mercies towards me? are they reſtrained? doubtleſs, thou art our Father, though</hi> Abraham <hi>be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of us, and</hi> Iſrael <hi>acknowledgeth us not. Thou O Lord, art our Father, our Redeemer, thy Name is from everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> Iſai. 63. Likewiſe, after that he had made this confeſſion, <hi>We are all as an unclean thing, and all our righteouſneſſes are as filthy Rags, and we all doe fade as a leaf, and our iniquities like the wind have taken us away, and there is none that calleth upon thy name, that ſtirreth up himſelf to take hold of thee, for thou haſt hid thy face from us, and haſt conſumed us, becauſe of our iniquities,</hi> Chap. 64. He adds, <hi>But now O Lord, thou art our Father, we are thy Clay, and thou art our Potter, and we all are the work of thine Hand; Be not wrath very ſore, O Lord, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther remember iniquity for ever; behold, ſee, we beſeech thee, we are all thy People.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By this gracious and loving Title of Father, the prodigal Son is perſwaded to be able to oblige his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to have compaſſion of him; <hi>I will riſe and go to my Father, and will ſay unto him, Father, I have ſinned againſt Heaven and againſt thee, and am no more worthy to be called thy Son, make me as one of thy hired Servants.</hi> Thus, although we have forſaken our Heavenly Father, miſpent the Riches of his Grace, and lived a filthy and a prophane Life; Nevertheleſs, if we can be but
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:41646:151" rendition="simple:additions"/>moved with a ſerious and a true repentance, and ſay to him from our hearts, <hi>Father, I have ſinned againſt Heaven and againſt thee, I am no more worthy to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led thy Son.</hi> He will forget all the miſcarriages of our youth, and will paſs by all the offences that we have committed, out of ignorance or miſtake; nay, he will blot out all our wilful and deliberate ſins; he will not only embrace us when we ſhall caſt our ſelves at his feet, and in the arms of his Mercy; but he will meet and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive us as his deareſt Children: he will kiſs us with the bleſſed kiſſes of his Fatherly love; he will give un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us his Holy Spirit, that ſhall ſeal us for the day of Redemption, and ſhall aſſure us, that we are admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the liberty and all the priviledges of his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; he will ſhooe our Feet with the preparation of the Goſpel of Peace, and will give us all the aſſurances of our entire and perfect reconciliation. He will cloath us here upon Earth with the Robes of Righteouſneſs and Holineſs, and in Heaven, he will beſtow upon us uncorruptible Robes of immortality and Glory. In this life he will give us the foretaſts of Eternal Happineſs, and in the life to come he will lead us by the hand into the Banqueting Chamber, and will cauſe us to ſit there at Table with <hi>Abraham, Iſaack,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> and with all the Firſt-born whoſe names are written in Heaven. Out of this celeſtial abode, all murmurings and complaints, ſhall be baniſhed, but here ſhall be rejoycing and gladneſs, for the converſion of poor ſinners, and for their admittance into the Kingdom of Heaven. God himſelf ſhall invite the Holy Angels and bleſſed Spirits, to ſhare in theſe publick rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cings; ſaying to them, <hi>We muſt rejoyce, for theſe my Children were dead, but now they are alive, they were loſt, but now they are found again.</hi>
            </p>

How can I that am but dry Straw and Stubble, ſtand before an everlaſting burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. O God of Gods, if I did ſee thee ſitting upon the Throne of thy Glory, as Judge of thouſand thouſands of immortal Spirits wait upon thee, and ten thouſand Milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons worſhip thee; if I did ſee thee armed with Thunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolts, encompaſſed with Flames of Fire, like to thoſe of Mount</hi> Sinai: <hi>I ſhould not be only afraid, but I ſhould fall into deſpair. Inſtead of drawing near to thee I ſhould fly from thee, as</hi> Adam, <hi>and endeavour to hide my ſelf from thine Eyes, that cannot ſuffer the ſight of evil; I ſhould cry out as</hi> Moſes, I am afraid, and I tremble all over. <hi>Or, as the Prophet</hi> Iſaiah, Woe is me, for I am undone,
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:41646:153" rendition="simple:additions"/>becauſe I am a man of unclean Lips, and I dwell in the midſt of a People of unclean Lips, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 6. <hi>Or, it may be I may ſay with the Holy Apoſtle,</hi> Depart from me, for I am a ſinful Creature. <hi>But good God, I ſee that thy Throne, ſo full of Glory, is encompaſſed about with a Rain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow of an immortal and a refreſhing Colour. I ſee in it the undoubted aſſurances of my Peace, and Eternal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation with thee; therefore I dare go to it with confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, as to the Throne of Grace, to obtain Mercy, and find Grace, to be helped in time of need. Although thou art Clothed with Majeſty, and Crowned with Glory, thou doſt ſtretch out unto me the Golden Scepter of thine infinite Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies. I ſee that thou haſt put off the Arms of thy Juſtice and Vengeance, to put on the Bowels of Love and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion. I hear no more over my Head, the dreadful Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of thy Curſes, but I hear the ſtill voice of thy Mercy, that comforts my trembling Soul, that raiſeth up my droop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Spirit, and that cauſeth me to conceive the aſſured hopes of Happineſs and Glory, in thine Heavenly Paradiſe. I ſee no more about thee the grievous flames and burnings, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour ſinful Men; but I perceive the pleaſant and refreſhing flames of thy Love, that rejoyce and comfort me, and that do not deſtroy me as they did the two Captains and Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers of</hi> Ahaziah, <hi>but they carry me up to Heaven as the Prophet</hi> Elijah <hi>was. The ſpirit which thou haſt given me, is not the Spirit of Bondage, to encline me to fear, but the ſpirit of Adoption, whereby I cry</hi> Abba, Father. <hi>It is this ſpirit that witneſſeth with my ſpirit, that I am thy Child, thy Heir, and Co-heir with thy Holy Son Jeſus. Seeing thou haſt reconciled me to thy ſelf by the Bloud of thy Beloved Son, when I was a Slave of Satan, and thy ſworn Enemy; now that I am ſo nearly related to thee, wouldeſt thou refuſe me mine Inheritance? O my God, my Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Father, I know that I have grievouſly offended thee, and that if thou didſt treat me exactly according to thy Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, of a thouſand Articles, I could not anſwer one; therefore I ſhould have cauſe to expect to be caſt into the
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:41646:153" rendition="simple:additions"/>Eternal Fire, prepared for the Devil and his Angels; but Lord thou doſt not deſire the death of a ſinner, but rather that he ſhould turn to thee and live. Moreover, thou haſt confirmed this with an oath, and thou wilt never break it. I confeſs that my ſins are many, and that their hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouſneſs appears unto me day and night; but Lord, where ſin abounds, thy Grace, or thy Mercy ſuperabounds: and when mine iniquities ſhould be as red as Vermilion, thou haſt promiſed to render them as white as Snow; Thou ſhalt be moved for me with the ſame compaſsion as a Father is mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved for his Child, and thou wilt put away from thee all mine offences as far as the</hi> Eaſt <hi>is from the</hi> Weſt. <hi>O my Soul, why art thou afflicted? why doſt thou fret within me? return to thy Reſt, my Soul, for the Lord hath done thee good; he prepares for thee an Eternal Felicity. It is not Death's voice that I hear, but the Call of mine Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Father, who invites and commands me to come away to him: Therefore, though I am a moſt miſerable ſinner, I am going to caſt my ſelf at thy feet, and to ſay to thee as the prodigal Child,</hi> Father, I have ſinned againſt Heaven, and againſt thee, and am no more worthy to be called thy Son. <hi>O my God, and Father, thou haſt beſtowed upon me, thy moſt Divine Favours, thy greateſt Riches and Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings; nevertheleſs, I have been eſtranged from thee, and have unhappily abuſed all thy Mercies. I have too much gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven my ſelf over to the debaucheries of the Fleſh, and of the World; evil company hath corrupted my behaviour; ſo that from the ſole of the Foot, to the crown of the Head, there is nothing whole in me. In this miſerable Eſtate, I fly to thee my Judge for Mercy, or rather, I implore and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat with all my Heart thy Fatherly Love, to have compaſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of me. O Divine Flames, O Abyſſe of Charity, O God, whoſe tenderneſs for me is far greater than that of the beſt Fathers, and of the moſt tender hearted Mothers for their Babes; I ſee thy Bowels move for me, thy compaſſions kindle, and thy Arms wide open to receive me; thou art not only ready to embrace me, but thou meeteſt me in the way; not
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:41646:154" rendition="simple:additions"/>only as the Father of the prodigal Son, thou doſt not only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive me, but thou haſt ſought me out in my former abode of corruption, and drawn me out of thoſe depths of Miſery. O unparalell'd Love! what may not I expect from thy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly kindneſs; thou ſhalt embrace me with the Arms of thy Mercy, and kiſs me with the kiſſes of thy Love; thou ſhalt confirm my aſſurance, of being admitted into the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of thy Children, and give unto me a white Stone, where thou ſhalt write the new Name of</hi> Elect, <hi>or</hi> Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, <hi>that none knows but him that hath it. Thou wilt ſhooe my Feet with the preparation of the Gospel of Peace; or rather, thou ſhalt give unto my Soul, that peace of God that paſſeth all underſtanding. Thou ſhalt put upon me the Robes of fine and white Linnen, which are the Righteouſneſs of the Saints, and thou ſhalt cloath me with the Rayes of the Sun of Juſtice. Thou ſhalt lead me into thy Dwelling, I mean, thy Glorious Palace, where, inſtead of killing the fatted Calfe, we ſhall ſolemnize the Nuptials of the Lamb, offered from the foundation of the World, there we ſhall meet with the Angels, the immortal Spirits, and all the Firſt-born, whoſe names are written in Heaven, who ſhall not murmure nor complain, but ſhall be tranſported with joy, and adore that infinite Goodneſs which thou haſt decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to us poor and miſerable ſinners, who out of thine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehenſible Love, haſt made us thy Children and Heirs of thy Kingdom. O Goodneſs, worthy of the admiration of Heaven and Earth, we were all loſt, but we ſhall be all found in God, we were dead, but by death, we ſhall return to life; we were over-whelmed in a grievous miſery, but by this means we ſhall attain to the greateſt happineſs. O my God, I recommend unto thee my Soul, as to a faithful Creator, Heavenly Father, my Spirit I leave in thy Hands,</hi> Amen.</p>

            <head>CHAP. 15. </head>
            <argument>
               <p>
                  <hi>The third Conſolation againſt the fears of Death, is to repreſent continually unto our ſelves, the Death and Sufferings of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and to truſt upon the merits of his Croſs.</hi>
               </p>
            </argument>
            <p>IF we will dye with a peacable and quiet mind, we muſt always repreſent to our ſelves the death and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and rely upon the merits of his Croſs; for the death of this Prince of Life ſhould be the Model of ours, and the bottomleſs Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of Comforts to a believing Soul.</p>
            <p n="1">1. By looking upon this perfect example, the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Men and Angels, we learn to endure with an Holy reſolution and patience, all the evils and pangs that accompany Death, <hi>Luk</hi> 22. For although our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours Torments were moſt bitter, ſo that his Soul was ſorrowful unto death, although there iſſued out of his innocent Body, a bloudy Sweat for the violence of his pain; nevertheleſs, none ever heard the leaſt murmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, or expreſſion of impatience, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 53. He was led to the ſlaughter as a Lamb, and as a Sheep before the Shearer, is dumb.</p>
            <p n="2">2, From hence we learn, that the laſt hours of our life, muſt be employed in fervent and continual Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers unto God, ſeeing, that this Beloved of the Father, offers unto him at ſuch a time his Prayers and Suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, with great Cries, and a floud of Tears, as to him who was able to deliver him from Death; <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. In the boſoms of this Heavenly Father, he poureth out all his Griefs, and three times he preſents this requeſt, <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, if it be poſſible that this cup ſhould paſs away from me, except I drink it,</hi> Matth. 26.</p>
            <pb n="316" facs="tcp:41646:155" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p n="3">3. We learn to preſent our ſelves before God's Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Majeſty with Humility, and to reſigne our ſelves wholly to his wonderful Providence; ſeeing that he who thought it no robbery to be equal with God, he whom the millions of Angels and Seraphims worſhip continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, thought it no diſgrace to himſelf to fall upon his knees three times to the ground, and ſubmit his Will to that of his Heavenly Father, for after that he had ſaid, <hi>Father, if it be poſsible, let this cup paſs away from me, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept I drink it.</hi> He adds theſe words, <hi>Nevertheleſs, O Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, not as I will, but as thou wilt,</hi> Matth. 26.</p>
            <p n="4">4. If at the time of our death, an exceſſive ſorrow, or a malignant humour ſeize upon our minds, ſo that in that diſpoſition we are not able to ſee the Heavens open, nor God who ſtretcheth out his Arm to receive us into his Reſt; Let us remember that this merciful Lord ſpeaks to us as he did to his three Apoſtles, who fell aſleep, when he was in his Agony, <hi>Cannot you watch one hour with me? Mat.</hi> 29. My dear Children, it is no time to fall aſleep with the fooliſh and inconſiderate Virgins, trim your Lamps, put on the Garments of Light, to meet your Celeſtial Bridegroom, and to enter with him into the Marriage Chamber, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.</p>
            <p n="5">5. God requires that we ſhould do as much good at all times to our friends as we are able, and to expreſs the ſincerity of our affections, to thoſe with whom Nature and our Duty have cauſed us to be related, but eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally at the hour of death, we are more bound to this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Duty; therefore Jeſus Chriſt hath ſhewn us an excellent example, for when he was nailed to the Croſs, and ready to breathe forth his Soul into the hands of his Heavenly Father, he had an eſpecial care of his Holy and Bleſſed Mother, ſaying to his beloved Diſciple, <hi>My Son, behold thy Mother,</hi> and to her, <hi>Woman, behold thy Son.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. We muſt not only do good, and ſhew kindneſs to our friends, but we muſt forgive our greateſt enemies, ſuch alſo as employ their greateſt fury againſt us; for by
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:41646:155" rendition="simple:additions"/>this means we ſhall follow the Bleſſed footſteps of our Gracious Saviour, for he had compaſſion upon them that crucified him, and mocked him; <hi>Father,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>forgive them, for they know not what they do.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7. By the Croſs of Jeſus Chriſt, we learn to put our truſt in the goodneſs of God, in our greateſt pangs, and to embrace him as our moſt loving Father and Redeemer, when he ſeems to diſcover to us a ſevere countenance, full of wrath and diſpleaſure for this Eternal Son of God, in his moſt violent tortures, when his Heavenly Father did ſuſpend his aid and aſſiſtance, and withheld the effects of his Grace, the expreſſions of his Love, and the comforts of his Divine Spirit; nevertheleſs, he looks upon him as his God, and repoſes himſelf upon him; he prays un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him with an Holy aſſurance, and repeats theſe paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate words, <hi>My God, my God!</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="8">8. If we will dye willingly, and leave theſe crazy Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies with a joyful mind, when the time is come, that we muſt go to the Father of Spirits; we muſt remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber with what reſolution our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt prepar'd himſelf for death, and how willingly he commended his innocent Soul into the hands of God his Father, when he required it; <hi>No man taketh my life away from me, but I lay it down of my ſelf, I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again; this Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment have I received of my Father,</hi> John 10. Heb. 10. This cauſed him to ſpeak in this manner, <hi>Here am I, O God, to do thy will,</hi> Luk 23. Therefore when he gave up the Ghoſt, he cried with a loud voice, to ſhew that his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Soul was not taken from him by violence, but that he did willingly offer it up as a Sacrifice to God.</p>
            <p n="9">9. In this rich deſcription of Chriſt crucified, we may further learn what ſhould be our laſt words, and laſt thoughts; for if God vouchſafes to us the uſe of our Tongues, until the laſt gasp we cannot end our life more comfortably, than by ſuch expreſſions as our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour made uſe of upon the Croſs; <hi>Father, into thy hands
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:41646:156" rendition="simple:additions"/>I commend my Spirit.</hi> But if we cannot move our Lips, and that we cannot pronounce theſe words, we muſt inwardly meditate upon them in our minds, and expreſs them with motions of the Heart.</p>
            <p n="10">10. When we look more narrowly into the death and paſſion of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, we may eaſily find how much we are bound to give up our ſouls unto God, when he is pleaſed to call for them, for this Bleſſed death is the price and ranſom that he hath paid for them; now, if there be any reaſon to render unto every one that which hath been dearly bought, and purchaſed with a great price; and ſeeing that it would be a great ſin to refuſe unto any man, that which he hath paid for, with the Bloud of his only and beloved Son, how can we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe our Souls unto God, ſeeing that they belong to him? becauſe he hath not only created them and ſtamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in them his Image, but he hath alſo purchaſed them with the Bloud of his only Son, in whom, from all Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity he is well pleaſed. We muſt not therefore imitate the example of naughty paymaſters, or unjuſt poſſeſſors of other Men's Goods, we muſt not expect until our Souls be plucked from us by violence, but rather like the good and righteous Debtors, we muſt return them willingly, and yield them up into his hands who hath paid for them an infinite, and an unvaluable Ranſome. <hi>David</hi> was of this mind when he ſaid, <hi>Into thine hand I commit my ſpirit, thou haſt redeemed me, O Lord God of Truth,</hi> Pſal, 31.</p>
            <p n="11">11. In this Death and Paſſion of our Glorious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, we learn not only our Duty, but alſo ſufficient grounds of comfort and hope; and if I may ſo ſay, it is in the Bowels of this dead Lion, that we find the ſweeteſt and moſt raviſhing Conſolations; this Chief Prieſt, that bears us upon his Breaſt, in his Heavenly Sanctuary, or rather upon his Heart, will not forſake us in the day of our diſtreſs, and will not give us over to the fears and pangs of death, for ſeeing that he hath
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:41646:156" rendition="simple:additions"/>encountred with this cruel Death, ſeeing that it hath felt its ſting, its ſhiverings and pains, and that he hath bin tempted as we have bin in all things, except in ſin; he is merciful and faithful, to have compaſſion of our infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities; he is no leſs able to aſſiſt us in our temptations, and to make us in all things more than Conquerors.</p>
            <p n="12">12. Believing Souls, conſider with me the noble ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of <hi>St. Paul, Bleſſed be God, even the Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the Father of Mercies, and the God of all comfort, who comforteth us in all our tribulation, that we may be able to comfort them, which are in any trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, by the comfort wherewith we our ſelves are comforted of God,</hi> 2 Cor. 1. Theſe excellent Truths may be very well applied to our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, whom the Holy Ghoſt names, <hi>The Apoſtle and High Prieſt of our Profeſſion,</hi> Heb. 3. For the comfortable aſſiſtances which he hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from God, in the time of his greateſt anguiſh, are precious tokens, and infallibie aſſurances of God's future help in our need; for as, when he was in his bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Agony, when his Soul was caſt down with deadly ſorrow, an Angel from Heaven comes to comfort him. Likewiſe when we ſhall be engaged in an encounter with death, when it ſhall endeavour to fill our Souls with ſadneſs and apprehenſions, he will, doubtleſs, ſend unto us ſome of his good Angels, that be at his right hand, I mean the faithful Teachers of his Holy Word, or elſe he will ſend from Heaven ſome of his bleſſed Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits that ſtand about his Throne, and that are common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly employed in the preſervation of the Godly. The Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt himſelf, the Comforter of afflicted Souls, and the true Oil of Gladneſs, will then drive from our hearts all grief, and refreſh us with his Heavenly Comforts. He will not forſake us, until he hath brought us to the Head Spring of Eternal Joy and Comfort.</p>
            <p n="13">13. Our Lord and Saviours deliverance from death, is an Image, and an aſſurance of our future deliverance which we are to expect from God's Mercy, and Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:41646:157" rendition="simple:additions"/>Power; for as, when <hi>St. Paul</hi> ſaith, that this High Prieſt in the days of his Fleſh, offered up Prayers and Supplications, with ſtrong crying, and tears unto him, that was able to ſave him from Death, <hi>And was heard, in that he feard.</hi> We are not to underſtand, that he was freed altogether from death, but rather, that he had the favour granted to him of ſwallowing Death up into Victory, and of triumphing over the Powers of Hell; and that through the ſhame and bitterneſs of death, he is gone into his Glory, and into the Joys of his Heavenly Paradiſe. Likewiſe when we pray unto God in our great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt diſtreſſes, and deepeſt ſorrows, when we pour into his boſom the Tears of a ſincere Repentance; he hears us from his Sanctuary, and delivers us from Death, not by hindring us from dying, but by raiſing our Souls to paſs through Death into an immortal Life; from this valley of Tears, into Happineſs and endleſs Bliſs.</p>
            <p n="14">14. If we will be ſully perſwaded that God will not with-hold from us the Joys and Comforts of his Holy Spirit, and that he will make us more than Conquerors of death, by admitting us into an Eternal Felicity; we need but caſt our eyes upon our Lord Jeſus Chriſt; for as he who beſtows much will not refuſe a little; ſo God who hath not ſpared his only Son, but hath delivered him, for us all, to an ignominious and cruel Death; how ſhall not he with him freely give us all things? <hi>St. Paul</hi> hath taught to argue in this manner, and to gather this conſequence, neceſſary from God's proceedings, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.</p>
            <p n="15">15. When Chriſt our Lord gave up the Ghoſt upon the Croſs, the vail of the Temple was rent from the top to the bottom; Heaven was opened, and a repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Thief was admitted. All this happened, to teach us, that we may enter into the Holy of Holies, by the Bloud of Jeſus, by the new and living way, which he hath conſecrated, by the Vail, which is by his Fleſh; and that this merciful Lord hath always his Arms wide open to receive us, and that he will never refuſe the Glory of
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:41646:157" rendition="simple:additions"/>Heaven, and the delights of his Paradiſe, to the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſinners that repent, and that ſeek to his Eternal Mercy, by his infinite Merits.</p>
            <p n="16">16. The Death of this great God and Saviour, is the payment of all our debts, and the expiation of all our crimes, it is the healing of all our diſeaſes; the freedom from all our miſeries; for it hath overcome Satan, and the powers of Hell: It is the death of an Eternal Death, it is this meritorious death that hath purchaſed for us Heaven, and all its Excellencies, and procured to us a Right to God's Paradiſe, and to its Delights and Pleaſures. In ſhort, it is this Death that conveys Pardiſe into our Souls, before we enter into Paradiſe, and fills our minds with an Heavenly and Divine Peace, and an unſpeakable and glorious Joy.</p>
            <p n="17">17. This Croſs of our Saviour may be compared to the Wood which <hi>Moſes</hi> caſt into the Waters of <hi>Marah;</hi> for it takes away from the natural Death of God's Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, whatſoever is incommodious and bitter, and cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us to reliſh Sweetneſs and Comforts that cannot be expreſs'd; It is like the Salt which the Prophet <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſha</hi> caſt into the Waters of <hi>Jerico,</hi> to make them whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom and fruitful; for it cauſeth that death it ſelf proves our Salvation, and brings unto us unſpeakable comforts. I may alſo liken it to the Meal which the ſame Prophet caſt into the Pot, of which the Sons of the Prophets had made this complaint, <hi>O thou man of God, there is death in the pot.</hi> It is the death of Death, becauſe it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moves from it all deadly poiſon, and cauſeth us to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Angelical ſatisfactions. I may therefore juſtly ſay of this Glorious Croſs, that it is <hi>The Tree of Knowledge, of good and evil;</hi> Becauſe it makes known, and underſtood the dreadful evils from which we are delivered, and the infinite advantages which are procured to us <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

<pb n="322" facs="tcp:41646:158" rendition="simple:additions"/>Believing Souls, it is that Myſtical Ladder which <hi>Jacob</hi> ſaw in a viſion, for it unites Heaven and Earth, ſinful Man with his God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 28. It pleaſed the Father to make peace by the Bloud of the Croſs of his Son, and to reconcile all things unto himſelf, whether they be things in Earth, or things in Heaven, <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 1. It is by the means of this Bleſſed Croſs, that the good Angels are ſent to our aſſiſtance, and that all the Graces and Bleſſings of God, are procured unto us; by this Croſs we ſhall aſcend up to God, and to his Eternal Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, under the ſhadow of this Divine Croſs, our Souls do reſt, and enjoy the Peace of God which paſſeth all Underſtanding. It is like the Golden Scepter which King <hi>Ahaſuerus</hi> ſtretched out unto <hi>Eſther,</hi> for if we touch this precious Croſs with the hand of Faith, if we embrace it with a contrite Soul, we ſhall obtain from the King of Kings, not only the half part, but all his Kingdom, with all its Delights, Honours, and Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages.</p>
            <p n="18">18. <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Rod was chang'd into a Serpent, as well as the Rods of <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Magicians, but this Serpent devoured all the reſt. Thus the death of our Lord and Saviour is accompanied with Sorrow, Fear and Anguiſh, but theſe fears ſwallow up all other fears, and cauſe us to draw near with confidence to the Throne of Grace; his Sorrows drive away all our Griefs, and fill us with Joy and Eternal Comfort: his Anguiſh gives eaſe and ſatisfaction to our Souls; his troubled Mind is the cauſe of the ſettlement of our Conſciences; his drops of Bloud do waſh down our Tears; his Groans hinder us from Sighing; and his grievous cryings do cauſe us to ſing with Joy, The Fetters of this Glorious Redeemer have purchaſed our Freedom, and his Condemnation, our Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution; he hath been content to drink Vinegar ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with Gall, and to ſwallow the very dregs of the Cup of God's Wrath and Juſtice, that he might cauſe us to drink of the Rivers of his Divine Pleaſures. He cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:41646:158" rendition="simple:additions"/>out in the violence of his Grief, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> Matth, 27. That God might never forſake us, and that in our greateſt troubles, we might have always his fatherly aſſiſtance, ready at hand; he hath ſtooped his Head to raiſe our hopes. In ſhort, he is dead, that he might deliver them, who through fear of death, were all their life time ſubject to a cruel and unſufferable Bondage, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. So that all ſuch as tremble and are afraid at the approaches of Death, have not yet felt the power and efficacy of the Croſs of our Lord Jeſus. They trample under feet the Bloud of the Son of God, and as much as in them lies, they render the fruits and efficacy of this bleſſed death of no effect.</p>
            <p n="19">19. Conſider well, Chriſtian Souls, and imprint in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to your minds this Leſſon; Remember that death is never to be feared, but when it proceeds from God's wrath, and the curſe of his Law; and when our ſins and offences have ſupplied it with offenſive weapons, when the Devil, who ſeeks to devour us as a roaring Lion, follows death at the heels; and when, at the ſame time, Hell opens its infernal jaws to ſwallow us up: But thoſe who have placed their Faith and Hope in the Death and Paſſion of the Saviour of the World, and who embrace his Croſs, are exempted from all its fears, and out of the reach of all its poiſonous Darts.</p>
            <p n="20">20. My beloved Souls, be not therefore frighted to ſee the face of the great Judge of the World, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. Seeing that there is ſuch an excellent Mediator between God and Man, namely the Man, <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> who hath given himſelf a Ranſom for all, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. He hath diſarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed God's Eternal Juſtice, and ſtopt the proceedings of his Vengeance, for God hath appointed him for all E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity, to be a Propitiation by Faith in his Bloud, <hi>John</hi> 5. The Father judges no man, but hath given all Judgement to the Son, as he is the Son of Man. There is now no condemnation to them that are in Jeſus Chriſt;
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:41646:159" rendition="simple:additions"/>whoſoever believes in him, ſhall never come into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, but is paſſed from Death to Life, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. <hi>John</hi> 5.</p>
            <p n="21">21. Fear no more the Thunderbolts, and the flaſhes of Fire of Mount <hi>Sinai;</hi> neither do you tremble, when you hear its horrible Thunder, <hi>Curſed is every one, who continues not in all things written in the Book of the Law, to do them,</hi> Deut. 28. For although Chriſts Hands be nailed and faſtened to the Wood, they pluck, neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, out of the Hands of God's Juſtice, his terrible Thunderbolts, and the Sword of his Vengeance. The precious Bloud that runs down from the wounds of this Divine Redeemer, do quench the ſcorching heat of his Eternal burning. As at the morning of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours Paſſion, he had a care of his Diſciples, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he deſired thoſe that came to take him, <hi>If you ſeek me, let theſe goe.</hi> John 18. Likewiſe he hath now a care of all ſuch as believe in his name, to ſecure them under the ſhadow of his Croſs. He takes their place, and for them he ſtands before God's juſtice, ſaying, Seeing that you have taken me to be their pledge, and that you have purſued me without Mercy; ſeeing that I have ſufficiently ſatisfied for all their crimes, and have taſted for them, the moſt bitter and cruel death; ſuffer them to enjoy the freedom that hath been pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed at ſuch a dear rate. Suffer them to paſs through death, into the enjoyment of a bleſſed Life, which is the price of my Bloud, and the fruit of my Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. This merciful Redeemer hath put himſelf, of his own accord, in our ſtead, and hath endured, in his own Perſon, all the pains which were due to our ſins; he hath been ſtruck with <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Rod, and pierced through with the Darts of the Law; he hath been made a Curſe for us, for it is written, <hi>Curſed is every one that hangeth upon a Tree,</hi> Gal. 5. But we are not only by his means redeemed from the Curſe of the Law, but we are alſo bleſſed in him, with all manner of Heavenly
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:41646:159" rendition="simple:additions"/>Bleſſings; when we were without Chriſt, we were Aliens from the Common-wealth of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> having no Hope, and without God in the World; But we, who were far off, are made nigh by the Bloud of Chriſt; we have acceſs with confidence by Faith in his preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Bloud, ſo that we may go with boldneſs to the Throne of Grace, to find mercy and help in time of need, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. Rejoyce therefore Chriſtian Souls, for you are not come to the Mount that might be touch'd with hands, nor to a burning Fire, nor unto Blackneſs and Darkneſs and Tempeſt, and the ſound of a Trumpet, and the voice of words, which voice, they that heard, intreated that the word ſhould not be ſpoken to them any more, but ye are come unto mount <hi>Sion,</hi> and unto the City of the living God, the Heavenly Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem, and to an innumerable company of Angels, to the general Aſſembly and Church of the Firſt-born which are written in Heaven, and to God, the judge of all, and to the ſpirits of juſt Men made perfect, and to Jeſus the Mediator of the new Covenant, and to the bloud of ſprinkling, that ſpeaketh better things than that of <hi>Abel.</hi> For <hi>Abels</hi> Bloud called for vengeance againſt his own Brother, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. <hi>Col.</hi> 1. but the Bloud of Chriſt pleads for Mercy, Pardon, and Forgiveneſs for them, who were his enemies in their underſtandings, and wicked deeds. And if when we were enemies, we have been reconciled unto God by the death of his Son, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. How much more now, that we are recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled, ſhall we be ſaved by his life and interceſſion?</p>
            <p n="22">22. Never fear, neither the Devil nor all the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of Hell, for according to God's antient promiſe, <hi>The ſeed of the Woman ſhall bruiſe the Serpents head,</hi> Gen. 3. The Lord of Glory hath ſpoiled the Principa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities and Powers, he hath made a ſhow of them, open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly triumphing over them in his Croſs, <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 2. By his death, he hath deſtroyed him who had the Empire of death, that is the Devil, ſo that he hath cruſht to pieces
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:41646:160" rendition="simple:additions"/>this red Dragon that did devour whole Nations and People, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. As it happened when the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> did look to the brazen Serpent, which <hi>Moſes</hi> ſet up in the wilderneſs, they were perfectly cured of the bitings of the fiery Serpents; Likewiſe, you wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſinners who feel the venemous and deadly wounds of the old Serpent, caſt the eyes of your faith upon Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt crucified, and you ſhall be ſaved from death, <hi>John</hi> 3. As when the Angel deſtroyed the Firſt-born of <hi>Egypt,</hi> he had not the power to meddle with the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> who had ſprinkled their doors with the bloud of the Paſchal Lamb; ſo the Devil, who deſtroys the Children of this world, hath no power to touch thoſe, whoſe Hearts and Conſciences are waſhed in the Bloud of the ſpotleſs Lamb. And as <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and all the Egyptians that followed him, were overwhelmed and drowned in the waters of the Red Sea, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. which ſerved as a paſſage to the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> to their promiſed Land: Thus Satan and all his wicked Spirits are, as it were ſwallowed up in this precious Sea of Chriſts Bloud, which opens unto us a way to the cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtial <hi>Canaan.</hi> Rejoyce you Heavens, and you that dwell in them, for the accuſer of our Brethren is caſt out, who accuſed them day and night before God, but they have overcome him by the Bloud of the Lamb, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. <hi>Jam.</hi> 5. Chriſtian Souls, reſiſt the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, and he will fly from you; If he goes about as a roaring Lion, ſeeking whom he may devour, be not troubled at his fury, nor at his infernal power, for he is tied to a Chain, that he cannot ſtretch nor break; He hath been overcome by the Lion of the Tribe of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da.</hi> Take therefore the ſhield of Faith, that you may be able to quench all the fiery Darts of the Devil, <hi>Rev.</hi> 6. and ſpeak to him with an undaunted Soul; Get thee behind me Satan, for thou haſt no part in me, I belong to the Lord Jeſus, who hath paid my ranſom, who hath redeemed me with his Bloud, and ſealed me
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:41646:160" rendition="simple:additions"/>with his Spirit. The Gates of Hell have no power upon thoſe that are built upon the Rock of Eternity, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.</p>
            <p n="23">23. Let not your ſins caſt you into the Abyſſe of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair, nor drive you from the Anchor of your Hope; for God hath ſo loved the World, that he hath given his only Son, that whoſoever believeth in him, ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſting life; they that are whole have no need of the Phyſitian, but they that are ſick, <hi>John</hi> 3. Our Saviour is not come to call the Juſt to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance; ſuch as are puft up with a vain conceit of their own Righteouſneſs, but ſinners who acknowledge their faults and are ſorry for them. The ſacred Arms of your Redeemer that were ſtretched wide open up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Croſs, are yet ſtretched wide open to receive us; and from the higheſt Heavens where he dwells, he cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth theſe comfortable words to be heard, <hi>Come unto me all ye that travel and are heavy loaden, and I will give you reſt,</hi> Matth. 11. This merciful Lord is come to ſeek for the loſt Sheep, to ſave ſuch as were periſhed, and to redeem his people from their ſins. As by one Man Sin came into the World, and by Sin Death; thus death is come upon all Men, for they have all ſinned; likewiſe by the obedience of one, we are become conquerors over death, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. And we have obtained the gift of Righteouſneſs and Immortality; it is the Lamb of God that taketh away the ſins of the World, and that hath made an atonement for all our iniquitites, <hi>John</hi> 1. For as the Ram that was caught by the Horns in a Thicket was offered up unto God, as a burnt-offering, inſtead of <hi>Iſaack, Eph.</hi> 5. Thus the true Lamb of God hath been offered up unto God upon the Croſs for us as a Burnt-Sacrifice, well-pleaſing unto him, he hath born our iniquities in his Body upon the Tree, and by his ſtripes we are healed, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 53. He hath born our griefs, and carried our ſorrows, the chaſtiſements of our peace was upon him. As <hi>Aaron</hi> did put upon the live

God hath made him who knows no ſin, to be made ſin for us, that we might become the Righteouſneſs of God in him, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. <hi>Acts</hi> 10. Whoſoever believes in him ſhall receive remiſſion of ſins in his Name. Therefore ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than to play the deſperate, as <hi>Cain, Achitophel,</hi> and <hi>Judas,</hi> let us cry out with King <hi>David, O bleſſed is the man whoſe tranſgreſſion is forgiven, and whoſe ſin is co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered. O bleſſed is he unto whom the Lord imputeth no ſin,</hi> Pſal. 31. Or let us burſt out into <hi>St. Pauls</hi> language, <hi>Who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of God's Elect? it is God that juſtifieth. Who is he that condemneth? it is Chriſt that dyed,</hi> Rom. 8. Let us therefore embrace this crucified Jeſus, and ſay with the Bleſſed Virgin, <hi>My Soul doth magnify the Lord, and my Spirit hath rejoyced in God my Saviour.</hi> Or with the Glorified Spirits of Heaven, <hi>To him that hath loved us, and waſhed us from our ſins in his bloud, be Glory and Strength for ever and ever,</hi> Amen.</p>
            <p n="24">24. Chriſtian Souls, if the vaſt number of your ſins come into your remembrance, conſider that it is not ſaid, that the Bloud of Chriſt cleanſeth us only from a certain number of ſins, but, <hi>That if we confeſs our ſins, he is Faithful and Juſt, that is, True and Merciful, to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give us our ſins; and that the Bloud of Jeſus Chriſt, cleanſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us from all ſins.</hi> Let them be never ſo numerous, drown them all as ſo many helliſh Monſters, in the bloud of thy Saviour, take hold of this Divine <hi>Jeſus,</hi> with the Arms of Faith and Repentance; wrap your ſelves up in his Winding ſheet, repoſe your ſelves up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Croſs, and reſt ſecure in the ſhadow of his Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty interceſſion.</p>
            <p n="25">25. But if the grievouſneſs of your crimes fright you, take hold at the ſame time of the Horns of this myſtical Altar, and all the powers of Hell, will not be able to pluck you thence. Comfort thy ſelf, ſinful Soul, for there cannot be a ſpot ſo black, nor ſo deep, but the Bloud of Chriſt is able to waſh it clean away: There
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:41646:161" rendition="simple:additions"/>is no crime ſo grievous and horrid, but the Sacrifice of this Lamb without ſpot, that taketh away the fins of the world, can make an atonement for it. Let thy ſins be never ſo great, they have their limits, but thy Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers Merits are without limits, and the efficacy of his ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings continues for ever. To aſſure thee of this truth, and to encourage thee, he was pleaſed, upon the Croſs, to diſcover the Riches of his Mercy upon a wretched Robber, who ſuffered then the hands of Juſtice for his crimes: aſſoon as he ſaw him moved with Repentance, he changed his infamous and painful Croſs into a Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe of Glory and Happineſs, and filled his Soul with the ſweeteſt Comforts of his Holy Spirit. This mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful Redeemer is the ſame yeſterday, and to day, and ſhall be the ſame for ever. Therefore be never ſo foul and abominable a ſinner, if thou doſt groan under the burden of thy ſins, and art moved with contrition, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. thou oughteſt not to caſt off thy hopes, and to be diſcouraged; draw near with humility to thy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours Croſs, and waſh thy ſelf in the Bloud that comes out of his veins. All the diſeaſed perſons that entred into the pool of <hi>Betheſda,</hi> were healed of all manner of diſtempers, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. Likewiſe all ſpiritual diſeaſes are cured in this Divine Pool, of all their griefs; it is not neceſſary to ſtay till a good Angel from Heaven come to move the Waters, for Chriſt's Bloud is always freſh, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, and of the ſame Vertue and Efficacy; we need not fear that others ſhould ſtep down before us, or that the throng ſhould hinder us, for a thouſand worlds may be all healed at the ſame inſtant; neither do ye pretend that there is no body to caſt you into this my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical Pool, for our Lord will never refuſe to admit you when you ſhall have been Bedrid eight and thirty years, as the poor man that was troubled with the Palſie: and when you ſhall be nailed to a Croſs, as the good Thief, you may nevertheleſs dip your ſelves into this Divine Pool, and feel its ſaving and healing
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:41646:162" rendition="simple:additions"/>Vertue. It doth not only waſh away the filth, and heal all thy diſeaſes, but it gives alſo life to the Dead, and renders the living immortal: Whoſoever thou art that dippeſt thy ſelf in this precious Bloud, thou mayeſt ſay with the Apoſtle <hi>St. Paul,</hi> This is a faithful ſaying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Jeſus Chriſt came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the World to ſave ſinners, of whom I am the chief, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. Howbeit I have obtained Mercy, the Lord will deliver me from all wicked work, and will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve me to his Heavenly Kingdom, to him be Glory for ever and ever, <hi>Amen.</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 7.</p>
            <p n="26">26. You underſtand therefore very well, believing Souls, that you have no cauſe to fear Death, ſeeing that all its Darts have been broken to pieces, all its Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor hath been torn, and that its ſpoils appear ſo viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly upon Chriſts Croſs. You may ſee the Claws of this old Lion, the paw of this devouring Bear, the Teeth and Poiſon of this infernal Serpent, and the Head of this prodigious Dragon; you may ſee death ſwallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up into victory, and the Prince of Life leading it in triumph: follow then the Glorious Chariot of this noble Conqueror, ſinging with the Apoſtle. <hi>O death! where is thy Victory? O Grave! where is thy Sting? The ſting of death is ſin, and the ſtrength of ſin is the Law, but bleſſed be God who hath given us the victory, through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.</p>
            <p n="27">27. Therefore when God ſhall draw near to you, covered with the vail of Death, be not terrified; ſeek not to run from him, and to hide your ſelves from his all-ſeeing Eyes, unto whom darkneſs is as the noon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. Although you are by nature poor, wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, blind and naked, you have more ſubſtantial Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments than Fig leaves, for you have the leaves of the Tree of Life, that are deſigned for the ſalvation of the Gentiles, <hi>Revel.</hi> 22. The Leaves that ſhall never fade, ſhall cover all your nakedneſs, and adorn your immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Souls; for it is the Eternal Righteouſneſs, the moſt

               <head>A Prayer and Meditation for a Chriſtian, who ſtrengthens himſelf againſt the fears of Death, by meditating upon the Death and Paſſion of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>O Merciful Saviour! who haſt cloathed thy ſelf with our mortal Fleſh, that thou mighteſt offer it up as a Sacriffce to God; ſuccor me in my weakneſs, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the Faith and Hope which thou haſt begun in my Soul. I ſee Death threatening to deſtroy me, and ready with its jaws open to devour me. But Lord, I come to caſt my ſelf before thy Bleſſed Croſs, I take hold of the Horns of this Altar, I dip my ſelf in thy Bloud, I put on the Robes of thy Righteouſneſs, and wrap my ſelf up in thy Death. O Holy Redeemer! I know that thou haſt been diſtreſſed, and grievouſly perplexed at the approaches of Death; and that thine Agony hath been ſo bitter, that thou haſt ſweated drops of Bloud, and the Holy Angels have come down to comfort thee; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as thy Servants the Martyrs have gone to death, and their ſufferings, with expreſsions of Joy, as to a moſt ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did Banquet, or to a Triumph. Thou haſt prayed with ſtrong Crying and Tears to be delivered from death, and that this Cup might paſs away, ſo that thou mighteſt never taſt of its bitterneſs; But Lord! thy death was not as mine, and as that of thy bleſſed Martyrs. Thy death was an atonement for the ſins of the whole World; whereas our death is not intended as a ſatisfaction to God's juſtice, but rather to render us capable of receiving the bleſſed Fruits of his Eternal Compaſſions. Thou didſt bear the ſtrokes of God's Juſtice, and endure the fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his wrath, enflamed againſt the ſins which thou haſt loaded on thy ſelf: But we, inſtead of this conſuming Fire, which thou haſt quenched with thy precious Bloud:
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:41646:163" rendition="simple:additions"/>we perceive the flames of Love, inſtead of the Hand of thy juſtice; we ſee thy Arms wide open to receive us into E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Happineſs. Death, good Lord! was armed with our ſins and iniquities, and with all that is dreadful in Hell; but I ſee that all the Armor of Death are hung upon thy Croſs; they are the Trophies, and everlaſting marks of thy Glorious Victory. Thou haſt felt, not only the moſt ſenſible Darts of Death, but alſo the moſt terrible Thunderbolts, and fearful Curſes of the Law. Thou haſt ſecured us from all that violence; thou haſt redeemed us from the dreadful Curſes. When thou waſt made a Curſe for us, thou hadſt not only to encounter with death, but alſo to deſtroy him, who had the Empire of Death, and to break in pieces the Gates of Hell. Thou didſt ſpoil Principalities and Powers, ſhewing them openly, and triumphing of them in thy Croſs. O wonderful Saviour! How marvellous are thy Works, and worthy of the continual admiration of Men and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels? Thou haſt drunk up the very dregs of the Cup of God's fury, that we might never taſte of it, and thou haſt taken upon thee all the puniſhment that our ſins and offences had deſerved, that we might never feel them. Thy grievous pangs alleviate my torments; thy bruiſes and wounds are my health and cure; thy fears do comfort and ſettle my mind, and thy diſtreſſed Soul doth fill mine full of joy and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort; thy crying doth appeaſe the troubles of my Conſcience, and thy drops of Bloud do waſh down my Tears; thine affliction comforts me, thy ſorrow is my joy, and thy bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is my ſweetneſs; thy death is my victory, and thy Croſs is my Triumph; I ſhall no longer apprehend to dye, ſeeing thou didſt procure unto me Life and Immortality. O Glorious and Merciful Lord, the Kingdom of Heaven be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs unto thee by a twofold Right; it belongs to thee, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thou art the only Son of God, and the Heir of all things; it belongs to thee alſo, becauſe thou haſt purchaſed it with the infinite Merits of thy Sufferings; the firſt is ſufficient for thee, the ſecond thou haſt reſigned unto me, that I might one day enjoy this Heavenly Kingdom, as the
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:41646:164"/>fruits of thy Death, and the price of thy Bloud. I have hoped in thee Lord, I ſhall never be confounded; I know that nothing impure or defiled ſhall enter into thine Holy Jeruſalem, but thy Bloud ſhall waſh me from all my ſins, and make me as white as Snow. O Glorious Lord! O thou that art wonderful! how precious is thy death unto me? It is the payment of all my debts, the atonement of all my crimes, and the ranſom of the whole World; It is our peace with God, our re-union with Heaven, and our reconciliation with the Bleſſed Angels of Light; It is the death of Death it ſelf, and the ruine of Hell. In ſhort, it hath not only drawn me out of an Abyſſe of Miſery, freed me from Eternal Damnation, and the infinite torments of the bottomleſs Pit, but it hath purchaſed for me Heaven, with all its Glory and Paradiſe, with its unſpeakable De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights.</hi> David <hi>was much admired for making uſe of</hi> Goliah<hi>'s Sword, to cut off his Head; but who will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire and wonder at thee, O victorious Son of</hi> David, <hi>ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thou haſt ſwallowed up Death into Victory by thine own death?</hi> Sampſon <hi>was wondered at becauſe he killed a few Enemies by his death; but who will not wonder at thee, O Son of Righteouſneſs, who by thy death haſt deſtroyed all the enemies of our Salvation, and given to death itſelf, its death's wound?</hi> Jacob <hi>ſlept peaceably at the bottom of the myſterious Ladder, which reacht from the Earth up to Heaven; But, O my Lord God, I ſhall lay my ſelf down, and find more peace and quiet at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of thy bleſſed Croſs; ſeeing that by its means I have acceſs to the Father, unto whom thou haſt reconciled me, ſeeing that I may with boldneſs go to the Throne of Grace, to obtain Mercy and Help in time of need. Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, I diſcover in thy Croſs, not only the ſource of my ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Comforts, of my greateſt Joys, and of my nobleſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations; but I learn alſo there, how to dye well, and I perceive all the Vertues in their greateſt perfection, that ſhould accompany my Soul at its Egreſs out of this Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. O Lord! Who art Perfection it ſelf, and who
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:41646:164" rendition="simple:additions"/>haſt left me ſuch a notable Example, that I might imitate it, give me Grace to expreſs to all my Relations, that cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial and holy affection, and that tenderneſs which I ſee in thee; give me Grace to forgive with all mine Heart mine Enemies, that I may pray God for them who have perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted me with fury. Give me Grace in my greateſt pains, to follow the example of thy ſweet Nature, of thy Goodneſs, of thy Patience and noble Reſolution. Inflame my Soul with an earneſt Zeal for thy Glory, and with ſuch a love, as cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed thee to offer thy ſelf up in Sacrifice to God. Here I am O God, ready to perform thy Will; my Soul is none of mine, but thine, who art its faithful Creator, and its merciful Saviour. Seeing that thou haſt paid its Ranſom, that thou haſt waſhed and cleanſed it in thy Blood, cloathed it with thy Righteouſneſs, and put it in a capacity of entring into thine Heavenly Sanctuary, and of appearing before the Father of Lights, do with it as it ſhall ſeem good unto thee. O ſweet Jeſus, who haſt been pleaſed to Dye and be Crucified for me wretched Sinner, give me that Grace that I may for ever live and raign with thee, and that I may at every inſtant be ready to ſay with all my heart,</hi> I commend into thine hands my Spirit, for thou haſt redeemed it, thou who art the ſtrong and faithful God.

                  <hi>The Fourth Conſolation againſt the Fears of Death, is to Meditate often upon our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, as he did lie in his Tomb.</hi>

            </argument>
            <p>MAn doth naturally abhor and hate the ſight of Graves, ſome there are, that cannot paſs by a Church yard, without expreſſing a diſtaſte and ſecret diſpleaſure; not only ſuch as make their abode in glorious Palaces and ſtately Dwellings, but alſo ſuch as
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:41646:165"/>reſide in poor Huts, or in pitiful Cabins, ſuch as are ſhut up in black Dungeons, or expoſed to the inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the weather, who have no other covering then the Sky, can ever think upon Death without fear, when they are to think, that this Body muſt go into the Bowels of the Earth, and lie down in a ſtinking and noiſome Grave.</p>
            <p>If ye will baniſh from your Minds this dangerous ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion, and theſe needleſs fears, we muſt conſider ſeriouſly, with a religious application of our minds, That we muſt never abhor the Earth, becauſe our Bodies have been made of Earth, it hath been as it were the Mother that brings us forth.</p>
            <p>We muſt alſo conſider, that it is the order of nature, that all compoſed Bodies ſhould return at their diſſolution, every part to its firſt principle; therefore as the Soul mounts up to its firſt ſource, and returns to God that gave it; likewiſe it is no wonder, if the Body returns to Duſt, becauſe it proceeds from Duſt, and God hath pronounced a juſt Sentence in the earthly Paradiſe, which ſhall never be revoked, <hi>duſt thou art, and to duſt thou ſhalt return,</hi> Gen. 3.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Nicodemus</hi> inquired of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>How can a Man be born when he is old? can he enter the ſecond time in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Mothers Womb and be born,</hi> John 3. This ridiculous and unprobable conceit, is proved in a manner to be true in this occaſion, for we muſt enter again into the Womb of the Earth our common Mother, that we might be Born again, and paſs into another Life.</p>
            <p>It is not amiſs to conſider often, the notable inſtances, and excellent repreſentations of our Death, which St. <hi>Paul</hi> mentions in the 15 Chap. of the firſt Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinth.</hi> for our Bodies are as the Seed which is caſt into the Earth, that it might bring forth. <hi>O fool, that which thou ſoweſt is not quickned except it dye.</hi> It cannot flouriſh untill it rots. The Students of Nature inform us, that the generation of one thing is the corruption of another. In this occaſion we may ſay, that the corruption and diſſolution of this
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:41646:165" rendition="simple:additions"/>wretched Body, is the means and way that leads to a more glorious Generation. You that weep for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſe of your Friends and Kindred, when you ſee them laid in their Graves, remember what <hi>David</hi> ſaith, They that ſow in tears, ſhall reap with ſongs of Joy, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 126.</p>
            <p>Conſider that Death is the way of all fleſh, and the Grave is the laſt retreat which God hath appointed for all living; ſo that if we be loath to enter into the Tomb, we muſt deſire Almighty God to grant us a Lodging by our ſelves, to change the common courſe of nature, or to create for us another World.</p>
            <p>Now the Grave is not only the general Rendezvous of all Mankind, but it is a Couch where they reſt after this laborious and painful race; therefore when the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſpeaks of the Death of good Men, he ſaith, <hi>They enter into peace, they reſt in their Beds,</hi> Iſ. 57. For when he looks to the bleſſed eſtate of their Souls, he tells us, that they are entred into that great and eternal Peace that raigns in Heaven, but when he caſts an eye upon their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, he ſaith, that <hi>they reſt in their Beds.</hi> For this cauſe the places appointed to bury the Dead, are named ſlee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping places, by the <hi>Greeks,</hi> to teach us that there they are fallen aſleep, in expectation of the great Morne, when God ſhall ſend to awaken them, with the ſound of the Archangels Trumpet.</p>
            <p>Therefore when <hi>Jacob</hi> was ready to give up the Ghoſt, he commanded his Son <hi>Joſeph</hi> not to bury him in <hi>Egypt, that he might ſleep with his Fathers,</hi> Gen. 47. Likewiſe <hi>Job</hi> ſpeaks in the ſame manner, <hi>I ſhall ſleep in the Duſt of the Earth,</hi> Job. 7. And God held this Language unto <hi>Moſes, Thou art going to ſleep with thy Fathers,</hi> Deut. 31. and to <hi>David, when thy days be fulfilled, thou ſhalt ſleep with thy Fathers,</hi> 2 Sam. 7. And when the Prophet <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel</hi> ſpeaks of ſuch as were deceaſed ſince the Creation of the World, he ſaith, <hi>They ſleep in the duſt of the Earth,</hi> Dan. 12.</p>
            <pb n="338" facs="tcp:41646:166" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p>Eſpecially take notice, Chriſtian Souls, that when God ſpoke to <hi>Moſet</hi> from the midſt of the burning buſh, he told him, <hi>I am the God of Abraham, the God of Iſaac, and the God of Jacob,</hi> Exod. 4. they had been dead many Ages before, nevertheleſs, God names himſelf their God, <hi>Now God is not the God of the Dead but of the Living,</hi> Mat. 22. Thoſe holy Men were not Dead, in regard of their Souls, becauſe they were Immortal, and God had admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them into Eternal Bliſs. Their Bodies alſo, to ſpeak properly, were not Dead, but ſlept in their Graves, as our S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The greateſt Princes, and the proudeſt Monarchs, are conſtrained to take up their Lodging, one after another; here in this Houſe, which God hath prepared for all li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, and to repoſe themſelves in that Couch, which is to receive all the Sons of <hi>Adam.</hi> When the Sacred Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory gives an Account of the Kings of <hi>Judea,</hi> and of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> it adds, at the end of their Life, <hi>He ſlept with his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</hi> Let us be never ſo wretched, poor, and miſerable, we ſhall all be entertained in this dwelling of Kings, and lay our ſelves down upon their Beds; therefore when <hi>Job,</hi> through the grieveouſneſs of his pain complained, becauſe he had not Dyed immediately after his Birth, he ſaith, <hi>for now ſhould I have lain ſtill and been quiet, I ſhould have ſlept then, had I been at reſt with Kings and Councellors of the Earth, which built deſolate places for themſelves, or with Princes that had Gold, who filled their Houſes with Silver.</hi>

            <p>In ſhort, there is nothing more able to remove from our fancy, that horror of our Graves, then the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, who is entred into the Earth as well as other Men, and hath laid himſelf down there. He hath Sanctified and perfumed that place with his Divine Preſence; he hath made it the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of our deſires, and the cauſe of our glory; for there is no Subject but judgeth it an honour to lodge in his Princes Chamber, and to lay down and ſleep upon the Bed, where he hath taken his reſt, although he hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained there but a moment, or an hour. O glorious Tomb, where Death and Life, Diſgrace and Glory are lodged together, and where the Prince of Life, the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of all Honor and Happineſs did reſt himſelf.</p>
            <p>Chriſtians, who deſire to baniſh from your Souls all fears of Death, and apprehenſions of your Graves, look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your Sepulchres in the ſame manner, as if you ſhould ſee there Jeſus Chriſt the King of Glory, the Prince of your Salvation yet remaining aſleep.

But believing Soul, God works for thee in this occaſion, a far more wonderful Miracle, for our Reſurrection and Life, proceed from the Death and Burial of our great Prophet. If we go into this holy Tomb, if we lay our ſelves down upon this precious Body, if we embrace it with a true and living Faith, and a ſerious Repentance, he will quicken us again, and cauſe us to become Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, for he hath been pleaſed to enter into the eſtate of the dead, with an intent to procure unto us, a bleſſed and a glorious Immortality.</p>

               <p>O <hi>Wonderful Mediator, between God and Man!

            </argument>
            <p>AS there is nothing more grieveous and unſuffera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, than to behold a proud and inſulting Enemy, who is alwayes victorious, and whom none can overcome in his inſolent and braving humor; likewiſe, there is nothing more pleaſant and comfortable, then to ſee ſuch a pride caſt down, and to overcome ſuch an Enemy. Therefore the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> who had long groaned under the cruel tyranny of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> ſung with Joy a Song of Triumph and Thankſgiving, when God deſtroyed that wretched Tyrant, and Buried him and his Army in the waves of the Red Sea. For this cauſe, when the Red Dragon, the ancient Serpent, called the Devil and Satan, <hi>Exod.</hi> 15. who ſeduceth whole Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, was overcome, and caſt down from Heaven to the Earth; There were Songs of Joy and Gladneſs heard in Heaven, <hi>Revel,</hi> 12. <hi>Now is come Salvation and Strength, and the Kingdom of our God, and the Power of his Chriſt, for the Accuſer of our Brethren is caſt down, which accuſed them before our God day and night, therefore rejoyce ye Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, and ye that dwell in them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From hence let us conclude, Chriſtian Souls, as it was a grievous Affliction, and a ſenſible Grief, to behold Death tyranniſing over all the World, and ſhutting up in its Dungeons, Kings and Monarchs, Patriarchs, Prophets, Apoſtles, Martyrs, and generally all the Children of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, of what condition or degree ſoever; likewiſe it is a great comfort, and unſpeakable joy to us, to behold this cruel and proud Enemy brought down, overcome,
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:41646:168" rendition="simple:additions"/>and diſarmed, to ſee our Lord Jeſus Chriſt marching out of Deaths fortifications, loaden with its Spoiles; rejoyce therefore ye Heavens, and ye that dwell in them, for the Murderer of our Brethren, is ſwallowed up into Vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory.</p>
            <p>We who are the Members of this great Conqueror, have a ſhare in his Honour and Glory, in his Perſon, we are Conquerors of Death, ſo that we may ſay with the Apoſtle, <hi>That God hath quickened us together, and raiſed us up with him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Prince of Life, hath not only looſened all the bands of Death, and broken to pieces all its chains, but he hath led away Death in Triumph, and made it ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to his Celeſtial Empire. He hath an abſolute power over Death, as he himſelf declares in theſe words, <hi>I am he that liveth and was dead, and behold I am alive for evermore, Amen, and have the Keys of Hell and of Death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For it ſtands with reaſon, that if this invincible Lord, when he was in the Priſon of Death, commanded over Death itſelf; if he broke in pieces its Iron bars, and its Braſen gates; if he cauſed the Dead to go out, and led them into the Holy City, now that he is out of the Grave a victorious Conqueror, he muſt needs command with an uncontrolable power, this dreadful Enemy which he hath already overcome, and brought under by his Almighty Hand.</p>
            <p>O Death! fret and fume out thy rage and fury, I ſee that thou art tied as a Priſoner, to the Triumphing Charriot of Jeſus Chriſt my Saviour, and I am certain, that thou canſt do nothing without leave, and that thou canſt not go a ſtep, unleſs he lengthens thy Chain.</p>
            <p>As <hi>Joſhua,</hi> when he had overcome the Kings of <hi>Canaan,</hi> called for his Captains, and ſpoke to them in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, <hi>Come near and put your feet upon the necks of theſe Kings, fear not, nor be diſmayed; be ſtrong and of good courage;</hi> Likewiſe we may imagine, believing Souls, that our Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine

               <hi>Joſhua,</hi> now that he hath conquered Death, calls to us from Heaven, tread upon this wretched Death with boldneſs, fear not, nor be diſmayed.</p>
            <p>The Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> that trembled at the threatnings of <hi>Goliah,</hi> were freed from all apprehenſions, when they ſaw him fall with a Stone from <hi>Davids</hi> ſling, ſo that the moſt timerous, could have freely put their feet upon his Neck. And ſhall not you Chriſtians, baniſh from your Hearts all fears and dread of Death, now that you ſee that it is caſt down at the feet of our true <hi>David,</hi> the great Shepherd and Biſhop of our Souls, for although it opens its Jaws, and that it fomes out flames of Fire, it hath nevertheleſs received the Stroke of Death, and is ready to give up the laſt gaſpe.</p>
            <p>And as the ſervant of <hi>Jonathan</hi> the Son of <hi>Saul,</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched and killed thoſe whom his Maſter had caſt down; Thus we need but purſue the glorious Victories of the Son of the King of Kings; or rather, we need but gather up the pleaſant Fruits of his Conqueſts, for this Prince of Life that hath overcome Death for us, offers to overcome it alſo in us, with the Weapons with which he arms us. In ſhort, to ſpeak properly, there can be no Death for ſuch as are Incorporated in Jeſus Chriſt, by a true and lively Faith, for he that lives and believeth in him, ſhall never Dye, and he that believeth in him, though he were dead, yet ſhall he live, <hi>Joh.</hi> 11.</p>

If thou haſt been able to deal with Death, when thou waſt ſhut up in a Dungeon; if thou didſt then, bring down its pride, and carry away its priſoners; what may not I expect, from thy Victorious and Almighty Arm, now that thou haſt in hand, the Keys of Hell and of Death. O moſt mighty and merciful Lord!

            <p>IT is a great joy and comfort indeed, to behold a cruel and a proud Enemy overcome and diſarmed, and our ſelves freed, by that means, from the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy yoke of his unſufferable Tyranny; but our joy would be turned into grief, and our comfort into ſadneſs, if we did but perceive at the ſame time the Author of our Freedome, choked with his own Blood, and breathing out the laſt gaſp, at the moment of his Victory, that our Sanctification might be entire, and our joy perfect; ſuch a Friend to our welfare, ſhould continue afterwards alive, and receive the Honors and Rewards due to him, for ſuch an expreſſion of his Valor and Kindneſs to us. There is no Enemy more cruel and more terrible, then Death, we have beheld it diſarmed upon the Croſs of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and perfectly vanquiſhed and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued by his glorious Reſurrection. But if with the eye of our Faith, we look a little higher, to behold the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Aſcenſion of our Divine Saviour, we ſhall ſee this
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:41646:170" rendition="simple:additions"/>ſame Death bound to his Triumphing Charriot, and we ſhall ſee this glorious Redeemer exalted above the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Heavens, and ſitting gloriouſly at the Right hand of God; we ſhall ſee him inveſted in an almighty Power, worſhipped by all the Creatures; we ſhall ſee him com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding, not only the Angels of Light, and the celeſtial Spirits that are about his Magnificent Throne, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding alſo over this World, over Death, the Devils, and Hell. Becauſe he hath been obedient unto Death, yea, to the ignominious Death of the Croſs, God hath highly exalted him, and given him a Name, which is above every Name, that at the Name of Jeſus, every knee ſhould bow, of things in Heaven, in Earth, and under the Earth, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. and that every Tongue ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, that Jeſus Chriſt is the Lord, to the glory of God the Father.</p>

For as the Father hath life in himſelf, he hath alſo given to the Son to have Life in himſelf, and as the Father rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth and quickneth the Dead, likewiſe the Son quickneth whomſoever he will. So that we may not only ſay to him as St. <hi>Peter, Thou haſt the words of eternal life, John</hi> 6. but we may juſtly ſpeak to him in <hi>Davids</hi> Language, <hi>with thee is the fountain of Life, in thy light ſhall we ſee light, Pſ.</hi> 36. Therefore all thoſe that are united and incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated into Jeſus Chriſt, do participate of the fulneſs of his holy Spirit, and by that means they became Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal. Now by the vertue of Chriſts Death and Paſtion, we are not only made partakers of the Fruits of his Suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, but we are united to, and Incorporated in him, ſo that by that means, we have obtained not only the gr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>t and precious promiſes of Glory and Immortality, which he hath purchaſed for us, by the infinite merits of his Sufferings, but we receive the Firſt-Fruits and foretaſts of our future bleſſedneſs.</p>
            <p>He that is lifted up and dwells on high, quickens the Spirits of the humble, <hi>Iſ.</hi> 57. he dwells in our hearts by Faith, <hi>Eph.</hi> 31. he pours into our Souls his holy and quickning Spirit, for becauſe we are the Children of God,
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:41646:176" rendition="simple:additions"/>he hath ſent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts to cry Abba Father, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. Whoſoever hath not this Spirit of the Lord Jeſus, he is none of his. By the means of this Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit he dwells in us and we in him, we become the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of his Body, and we may boaſt that we are his Fleſh and his Bones.</p>
            <p>All things that are moſt ſtrictly united by Nature or Art, are employed to repreſent this admirable union, <hi>John</hi> 6. which we enjoy with Jeſus Chriſt, by the means of his Spirit that quickens us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. From hence are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived theſe expreſſions of the holy Apoſtles, <hi>We have put on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> Gal. 3. And that <hi>when we draw near to him who is the living ſtone, rejected of Men, but lifted up and of great price with God,</hi> 1 Pet. 2. <hi>we like ſo many living ſtones, are built up together to make a Spiritual Houſe.</hi> For the ſame reaſon our Saviour informes us, <hi>John</hi> 15. <hi>That he is the true Vine, and that we are the bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.</hi> And St. <hi>Paul</hi> aſſures us, that if we are become one Plant with him, by the conformity of his Death, we ſhall alſo be one by the reſemblance of his Reſurrection. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.</p>
            <p>To ſhew unto us, that this Sacred Union contains ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ties of Love, our Lord Jeſus Chriſt is repreſented as our Brother, our Father, and our Bridegroom, therefore the Apoſtle tells us, that he thinks it no Diſgrace to own us for his Brethren, in ſaying, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. <hi>I will declare thy name unto my Brethren;</hi> and alſo where he informes us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. that <hi>God had predeſtinated us to be conformed to the Image of his Son, that he might be the firſt born among many Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.</hi> And after his Reſurrection, he ſpeaks in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> John 20. <hi>Touch me not, for I am not yet aſcended to my Father, but go to my Brethren and ſay unto them, I aſcend unto my Father and your Father, and to my God and your God,</hi> Heb. 2. Therefore this glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Redeemer ſhewing himſelf unto God with all the Elect, ſaith, <hi>Here I am, and the Children which thou haſt given me,</hi> Hoſea 2, And by the Mouth of <hi>Hoſea</hi> he ſpeaks
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:41646:176" rendition="simple:additions"/>to his Church, and makes this promiſe unto her, I will betroth thee unto me for ever, yea I will betroth thee unto me in Righteouſneſs and in Judgment, and in loving kindneſs and in Mercies. From hence it is, that this Church is called, <hi>The Spouſe of the Lamb in the Revelations;</hi> and in the <hi>Cantic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>es,</hi> the Spiritual Union betwixt Chriſt and his Church, is expreſſed by a continual Alluſion, to a Marriage between Man and Woman.</p>
            <p>And becauſe our Meat and Drink are turned into our Body and Subſtance, Jeſus Chriſt aſſures us, <hi>That his Fleſh is truly Meat, and his Blood is truly Drink. That he is the true Bread come down from Heaven, that gives Life to the World, and that whoſoever ſhall eat him, ſhall live for ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But amongſt all the Similitudes borrowed to repreſent our Union with Jeſus Chriſt by his holy Spirit, there is none employed more frequently in holy Scripture, than that of the Humane Body, for there is not any more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for us; all the Spirits that give life and motion, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from the Head, and aſſoon as the Members are ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from it they Dye. In the like manner the Spirit that quickens us, and makes us become new Creatures, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from Jeſus Chriſt, ſo that whoſoever is ſeparated from this Head, he falls into Death and Eternal Deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And as there are many Members, nevertheleſs they make up but one Body, becauſe they are all animated with the ſame Spirit, and they are kept alive by the ſame Head; l kewiſe there be many Members belonging to Chriſts Myſtical Body, ſome engaged yet upon Earth, and others glorified in Heaven, nevertheleſs they make up but one only Myſtical and Spiritual Body, for they are all quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the ſame Spirit, and receive all the celeſtial influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences from the ſame Head. St. <hi>Paul</hi> teacheth us this Doctrin in expreſſe terms, 1 <hi>Cor</hi> 12. <hi>For as the Body is one and hath many Members, and all the Members of that one Body being many are one Body, ſo alſo is Chriſt, for by one Spirit are we all Baptiſed into one Body, whether we be Jews
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:41646:177" rendition="simple:additions"/>or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free, and have been all made to drink into one Spirit.</hi> Finally, becauſe the ſame ſpirit that is in our Lord, as in the Head and Fountain, and in the Church in general, as in the Body which is quickned and moved, is alſo in every particular Member. The holy Apoſtle is not ſatisfied to call this Spiritual Body of Chriſt and his Church Chriſt; but he tells us moreover, that whoſoever is <hi>united unto him, is made but one Spirit with him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe and ſuch like Repreſentations, let them be never ſo lively and noble, are but dark ſhadowes and unperfect Images of our Union with Jeſus Chriſt by his holy Spirit; for the richeſt and moſt Magnificent Garment, can never keep off from the Body Diſeaſes, nor hinder the approa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of corruption that creeps upon it. There is no foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation never ſo firm and well ſetled that can free the houſe built upon it, from the ruines and breach s of time and the weather. Although the Sap mounts up from the root of the vine, and runs into the twigs and branches, they wither at laſt, and are caſt into the fire. The ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt Meats and the moſt delicious Drinks, can never make our Bodies become Immortal, Death ſnatcheth away the Brother from the Brother, the Father from the Child, and the Wife from her Husband. The ſtroke of a Sword can ſeparate a Body from the healthieſt and ſtrongeſt Head, nay without any ſuch violence, the Head dies as well as the Body, and the Spirits that run in our Ve ns, are far from hindring the corruption of our Bodies, for they corrupt of themſelves and vaniſh away. In ſhort, the ſtricteſt Unions of Nature and Art are diſſolved by time, ſo that all things under the Sun, are ſubject to vanity and unconſtancy. But the Spirit of the Lord Jeſus, is the principle of an eternal Life, and the Seed of an uncor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible gl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ry, whoſoever is united to him by this Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, nothing can ſeparate him from Chriſt, neither Life nor Death, neither Hell nor the World, nor things pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent nor things to come. Therefore becauſe our Bleſſed
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:41646:177" rendition="simple:additions"/>Saviour could find nothing here upon Earth, nor amongſt all the Creatures, worthy and able to repreſent this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and unſeparable Union, he ſeeks an Image of it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all natural beings, in the holy Trinity, in that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable Union, which was, which is, and which ſhall ever be, between him and God the Father. As we may ſee in his excellent Prayer, <hi>John</hi> 17. <hi>Father I pray for them all which ſhall believe on me, that they all may be one, as thou Father art in me and I in thee, that they alſo may be one in us, that they may be one ever as we are one.</hi> Baniſh therefore from your Souls all apprehenſions and fears, O believing Souls, for all the Three perſons of the moſt holy, moſt glorious and moſt wonderful Trinity, are engaged for your Salvation, and to bring you to your eternal happineſs. The Father by his infinite wiſdom, hath found out a means to reconcile us unto himſelf, to ſatisfie his offended Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, and to declare the riches of his unparalleld Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies. The Son hath purchaſed for us this great Salvation, by ſuffering the ſhameful Death of the Croſs, and by ſpilling his moſt precious Blood, for the forgiveneſs of our Sins; and the holy Spirit by incorperating us into Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, makes us partakers of the infinite Merits of his Sufferings, <hi>Revel.</hi> 2. That is the true Hyſop, that ſprinkles the Divine Blood of the Lamb, without ſpot or blemiſh, to cleanſe our Souls. It is he that gives to our Souls the white Stone, where the new name of <hi>Elect</hi> and <hi>Believers</hi> is written, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. which none knows but he that hath it. He gives us to eat of the hidden Manna, and of the food of Angels, <hi>Iohn</hi> 4. which the World knoweth not. It is inſtead of a precious Ring or Jewel, by which our ſpiritual Bridegroom promiſeth and confirms unto us his conjugal Faith. It is the Seal of the Living God, that Seals unto us the Covenant of Grace, and the promiſes of Glory and Happineſs made unto us in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, as the Apoſtle himſelf tells us, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. that now ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving believed the Goſpel of our Salvation, <hi>we have been Sealed by the holy Spirit of promiſe,</hi> Therefore he exhorts
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:41646:178" rendition="simple:additions"/>us Eph. 4. <hi>not to grieve the holy Spirit of God, by whom we have been Sealed for the day of Redemption.</hi> Finally, this is the Spirit that witneſſeth with our Spirits, that we are the Children of God, <hi>If we be children we are Heirs, Heirs of God, and joynt Heirs with the Lord Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> Rom. 8.</p>
            <p>Think not, Chriſtian Souls, that I labor to perſwade you, that this holy Spirit of the Lord Jeſus, ſhall come and whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per in your ears, or cry unto you from within, that you are the Children of God, as the extravagant Quakers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us imagine, the Teſtimony that he gives to our Spirits, is a real and an effectual teſtimony, if I may ſo ſpeak, for he regenerates us, and makes us become new Creatures, he gives us a more certain aſſurance of our adoption, then if he did declare from Heaven, <hi>Thou art my Child, and thy name is written in the Book of Life.</hi> As the Seal imprints its Image in the wax, thus the Spirit of the Lord Jeſus imprints in our Souls the Image of Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and all Divine Vertues; now as the Figure that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains upon the Wax, makes us judge without diſpute, what manner of Seal did print it; likewiſe when you find Gods Image imprinted in your Hearts, acknowledge the finger of God, and the Vertue of his holy Spirit to have been there; for none can have that bleſſed Image, but he muſt needs be the Child of God. The holy Spirit that gives it to our Souls, kindles in us the bleſſed flames of holy Love, and produceth in us Tongue; of fire; he makes us ſpeak to God with boldneſs as to our Father, and lift up our eyes to Heaven with joy and gladneſs, as to the place of our Inheritance. All the goods of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent life, may be, nay will be, loſt at laſt, <hi>Pro.</hi> 23. Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es take wings and flie away like an Eagle, Honor vaniſheth away, as a ſmoak carried away with the wind. Earthly Delights and Pleaſures haſt away as a Torrent or the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of a River that ſlide along the Banks, and they end at laſt in a Sea of bitterneſs and ſorrow. If by chance theſe vanities continue with the Worldlings, while they remain
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:41646:178" rendition="simple:additions"/>on Earth, <hi>Pſ</hi> 49. they can continue no longer, for they cannot carry beyond and the Grave, their Riches, their Honours are not Buried with them, and all their unſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led delights fly away with their Breath, but Death hath no power upon this Spirit of Life, which is our true Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, our glory and everlaſting delight.</p>
            <p>Moreover, the true and living Faith, that embraceth Jeſus Chriſt our Saviour ſhall ceaſe, and hope that conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders the advantages to come, ſhall one day be aboliſhed. Whilſt we are in this earthly Pilgrimage we walk by Faith, and not by ſight, and while we are toſt up and down up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this dangerous Sea of the World, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. we have need of the Anchor of our Hope, and to expect with patience the fulfilling of that we hope for, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. but when we ſhall come to our heavenly Country, we ſhall neither need a ſtaff to walk with, nor a ſhield to defend us, and to quench the fiery darts of the Devil, when we ſhall be ſecure in the Haven of Eternity; we ſhall have no occaſion to make uſe of this Anchor, for our hope ſhall be changed into a perfect Fruition. When we ſhall be in Paradice, we ſhall need no Wings to carry us up to God, but only to fly about his Throne, as the Seraphims. In ſhort, we need no looking glaſs to ſee the glory of God, for we ſhall behold face to face. All that we believe at preſent without ſeeing, we ſhall then ſee and believe no more. But the Spirit of the Lord Jeſus whom the World knoweth not and cannot receive; he is not given us for a time, but to dwell in us for ever. As that Fleſh which our Lord took from us was never caſt off, nor never ſhall; Thus the Spirit which he given us, ſhall never be taken from us. The fleſh which our Saviour united in the ſame perſon with the Divine word, hath been glorified by this eternal Union, but the Spirit which he hath united to our Spirits, by this gracious Union, is the foundation of Glory, and of our eternal happineſs.</p>
            <p>This Spirit of Life is not only the Seal of the promiſes of God, but alſo the earneſt of our uncorruptible inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:41646:179" rendition="simple:additions"/>reſerved for us in Heaven. This is St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. for when he had ſaid, <hi>you have been Sealed by the holy Spirit of promiſe,</hi> he adds, <hi>which, is the earneſt of our inheritance, untill the Redemption of the purchaſed poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion, unto the praiſe of his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>glory.</hi> Becauſe this Divine Spirit is the Seal of the living God, he is the earneſt of his Inheritance; for this heavenly Image that it imprints in our Souls, ſhall be part of that glory with which he will Crown us in his holy Paradice. Therefore the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom that is various in every manner, doth not call this Spirit a Gage but an earneſt; for although both be given as a confirmation of promiſes, and an aſſurance of their accompliſhment, there is this difference, that Men commonly take back again the thing engaged, when that which is promiſed is done, but the earneſt remains always, and is part of the ſumme to be paid. As therefore the earneſt which is given is never taken away, but Men common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly add to it the remaining ſumme promiſed; likewiſe our Saviour never takes away from his Elect the Spirit of Adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which hath been once beſtowed upon them, but he increaſeth its Graces and Advantages, until he hath rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed them to the higheſt glory, and moſt Divine happineſs, which he hath promiſed.</p>
            <p>It is in this occaſion as with the Sun, which as ſoon as it appears upon our Horizon, increaſeth the Light more and more, untill he is mounted up to our Meridian, or as the Rivolets and Rivers, which the farther they run, the more they increaſe, untill they diſcharge into the Sea; Therefore when our Lord and Saviour ſpeaks of this Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Grace, which ſuch as believe in him receive, he tells the Jews, <hi>John</hi> 8. <hi>He that believeth in me, Rivers of living Water ſhall flow from his Belly,</hi> John 4. and to the Samaritan Woman he ſpeak in this Language. <hi>He that ſhall Drink of the Water that I ſhall give him, ſhall never thirſt, but the Water that I ſhall give him, ſhall become in him a fountain of water ſpringing to eternal life,</hi> This was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſhewn in a Viſion to the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> Ezek. 47.
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:41646:179" rendition="simple:additions"/>by the waters that ran down from the Sanctuary, for at the firſt they did reach no higher then the Prophets An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kle bone, afterwards they riſe up to his knee, and then to his middle; at laſt they increaſed in ſuch a manner, that they became a great Torrent, and a deep River which was not to be forded over, and which diſcharged it ſelf into the Sea.</p>
            <p>As <hi>David</hi> in the beginning of his Raign, commanded but one Tribe, but afterwards he enlarged the limits of his Kingdom over all the Tribes of <hi>Iſrael</hi> that ſmall por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Kingdom was not then taken from him, but only increaſed and became greater; thus it is with us, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring this Life, we have ſmall part of the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven intruſted in our hands, or if I may ſo ſay, we have now ſome Jewels of the uncorruptible Crown which is promiſed hereafter: This part ſhall not be taken from us, this bright beam of our future glory ſhall never be put out but in the Life to come, we ſhall poſſeſs as much of this Kingdom as we are able, and ſhall be cloathed with all that light and ſplendor of the Heavenly Glory.</p>
            <p>But as there is no compariſon never ſo juſt, but is faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in ſome reſpects, there is no ſmall difference in this, for the Tribe of <hi>Juda</hi> was the nobleſt and the richeſt part of the Kingdom of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> but that part which our Souls enjoy at preſent of the happineſs and glory of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven, is but as a drop of Water in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Ocean, or as a weak raye of light, in compariſon, of the Sun 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. Therefore the Apoſtle St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who had been raviſhed into the Third Heaven, and who knew better than any Man in the World, what were the Joys and glories of Heaven, when he mentions this Spirit of Adoption that God ſends into our hearts, he calls it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. <hi>The Firſt Fruits of the Spirit.</hi> To teach us, that there is as vaſt a difference between the meaſure of the gifts and graces which we receive here below, and the overflowing abundance which we ſhall enjoy in Heaven, as between ſome few ears of Corn, and the whole Harveſt of a Field.
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:41646:180" rendition="simple:additions"/>It is like the ſmall quantity of Fruits which were brough<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> to the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the Wilderneſs, compared to the great abundance of all the Land of <hi>Canaan.</hi> It is like ſome ſmall crums of the Heavenly Bread, of which we ſhall have our fill in the Kingdom of God, as ſome ſmall drops of that New Wine which we ſhall drink for ever in the heavenly Jeruſalem.</p>
            <p>Therefore <hi>believing Souls,</hi> you may from hence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that the approaches of Death ought not to ſcare or fright you, becauſe that you have within you the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of a life everlaſting, and the ſeeds of a glorious Immortality, which cannot be taken from you. Jeſus Chriſt doth not only wait for you, and ſtretch out unto you his Arms, to receive you into his Reſt, but he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf is alſo with you, and will render the paſſage eaſie and pleaſant to this new World, where Juſtice and Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs dwell, <hi>Iohn</hi> 11. He will make Miracles for your ſake, and if you believe, you ſhall ſee the glory of God, <hi>Ioſhua</hi> 3. We do not only follow the footſteps of this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine and real <hi>Ioſhua,</hi> but we paſs with him, and he paſſeth with us, <hi>Exod.</hi> 19. We are not like the Children of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> that went through the River of <hi>Iordan,</hi> whilſt the Prieſts held the Ark in the middle of the River, but we may be compared to the Prieſts themſelves, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. that did bear the Ark of the Covenant, and cauſed the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to return up to their Fountain again, for we are a Generation of Prieſts, and we bear in our Souls the Lord Jeſus, in whom the fulneſs of the Godhead dwells bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily, and in whom are hid all the Treaſures of Wiſdom and Knowledge. In ſhort, our Souls return to God the Fountain from whence they came; Let therefore that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly voice which was heard in the holy Land, ſound in our ears, <hi>Iſ.</hi> 43. <hi>Fear not for I have redeemed thee, I have called thee by thy Name, thou art mine, when thou paſſeſt through the Waters I will be with thee, and through the Rivers, they ſhall not overflow thee, when thou walkeſt through the Fire, thou ſhalt not be burnt, neither ſhall the

            <p>It ſeems the Primitive Chriſtians had adeſigne to ſhew us this Truth by the Picture of a Giant-like man, wading through the Sea with a Staff in his hand, and a Child upon his Shoulder; for this Giant is the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blem of a Chriſtian, who lifts up his mind as high as Heaven; The Sea ſignifies the dangers of this World, and the fears of Death; The Staff repreſents Faith that keeps us up in our paſſage through Life and Death, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which, when we lean, we worſhip the living God of Heaven and Earth, and the Child is an Image of Chriſt; therefore he that bears him, is called <hi>Chriſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorus,</hi> that is, <hi>He that bears Chriſt. Ceſar</hi> could not endure to ſee his Pilot tremble in a furious Storm at Sea, becauſe he was in his Boat; we have far leſs rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to be afraid, ſeeing that we carry in our Hearts the great Emperor and Monarch of the World, the Hope and Comfort of <hi>Iſrael; Ceſar</hi> was as much in danger as his Pilot to make Shipwrack, but our Lord Jeſus Chriſt hath all the Winds at his Command. He can ſtill the moſt diſturbed Sea, and through the moſt grievous death, he can cauſe us to paſs and arrive to the ſafe Haven of an Eternal Reſt, and of a moſt happy and glorious life.</p>
            <p>When <hi>David</hi> ſhewed himſelf with a purpoſe to fight with <hi>Goliah,</hi> he ſpoke to this prodigious Philiſtines in this manner, <hi>I come unto thee in the name of the Lord of Hoſts, the God of the Armies of Iſrael.</hi> But you Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Souls, when you are to encounter with Death, you may ſay to it, not only I come to thee in the name of him, who Commands legions of Angels, and all the Armies of immortal Spirits, but I come to thee cloathed with his Armor, ſtrengthened by his Holy Spirit, and aſſiſted by him in perſon, for Jeſus Chriſt
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:41646:181" rendition="simple:additions"/>who hath overcome death for us, intends to overcome it by us. We are the living Stones which he hath cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen of his diſintereſſed Mercy, to bring down that proud inſulting Enemy, that cauſeth all Worldlings to trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and cover their faces with Shame and Confuſion, <hi>Judg.</hi> 6.</p>
            <p>We have already ſeen a <hi>Sampſon</hi> breaking in pieces, with a wonderful ſtrength, the Cords with which he had been bound by the Philiſtians, and tearing alſo the Body of a young Lion, in which he found ſome few days after, Honey, moſt pleaſant to his taſte. It will be much eaſier for us, when we ſhall be ſtrengthened with the <hi>Divine Vertue</hi> of the Lord Jeſus, of whom <hi>Sampſon</hi> was but a Type, to tear in pieces all the Cords and Chains of Death. We ſhall rent in pieces the Body of this old Lion, and when we ſhall ſearch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Bowels, with a ſerious and repeated meditation, we ſhall find the ſweeteſt and moſt raviſhing Comforts.</p>
            <p>As when the Prophet <hi>Elias</hi> was carried up to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in a fiery Chariot, he let fall his Cloak, with which <hi>Eliſha</hi> ſeparated the Waters of <hi>Jordan,</hi> ſo that he paſſed through the River on foot. Likewiſe our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt being aſcended up above the Clouds, to the Throne of his Glory, he hath left us the precious Cloak of his Righteouſneſs, he hath granted us his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit, that we might paſs through the turbulent Waves of this tempeſtuous Sea of the World, by its Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Vertue, and that through death we might enter into immortal Life.</p>
            <p>And as the death of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt ſeparated his Soul from his Body, although both his innocent Soul and Holy Body remained always united perſonal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to his Divinity. In the ſame manner the Believers death diſunites, for a time, his Soul from his Body, but it can never ſeparate it from the Spirit of the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, that is the Soul of our Souls, and ſuch an Holy Flame, that it can never be extinguiſhed.</p>

            <p>When the High Prieſt of the Jews put off his Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Garments, he caſt off at the ſame time his Breaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate, where the names of the twelve Tribes were engraven, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. Not only our names are written in the Lamb's Book of Life, not only our Pictures are printed upon the Palms of his hands, with the Bloud of the Covenant, but we be as a Signet upon his Heart <hi>Cant.</hi> 8. ſo that we cannot be ſeparated from him no more than his heart can be taken from him; his Love is ſtronger than Death, and his embraces are embraces of Love.</p>

               <hi>Ruth</hi> promiſed to <hi>Naomi,</hi> that Death alone ſhould be able to ſeparate them, <hi>Ruth,</hi> 1. But on the contrary, we may tell our Lord and Saviour, who is as our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Brother, and Husband, not only death ſhall never be able to ſeparate us, but it ſhall rather bring us near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er unto thee, and cauſe us to reſt in thy boſome, where we ſhall be for ever ſatisfied with thine Heavenly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights. Chriſtians, you need not fear Death, for you are not to be wounded by all its Darts, for you have been dipt in the River that ſprings to Eternal Life. The Spirit of the Lord Jeſus that is in you, is the Spirit of Life; the beginning of immortality, and the only Spring of Eternal Glory and Happineſs. Seeing that the breath of the Prophet <hi>Elias,</hi> raiſed a dead Body to life, the Spirit and the Breath of the Father, and of the Son will be able to keep your Spiritual life from decaying; unleſs it be in Death's power to ſtop the breath of the Almighty, unleſs it be able to limit the beams of Light and Glory that came from his Divine countenance; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it can cauſe the Rivers of living Water that ſpring out of his Throne to ceaſe and dry up; It is not poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that it ſhould cauſe us to periſh, and render us mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable. Therefore you are certain of your Eternal Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, while Jeſus Chriſt ſhall be the Author and Well-Spring of Light, Life, Glory, and Immortality; and that his Holy Spirit ſhall be victorious over Death and
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:41646:182" rendition="simple:additions"/>Hell; and you may ſing with <hi>David, I ſhall not dy but live and declare the Works of the Lord,</hi> Pſ. 118.</p>
            <p>You be not only ſure of this Glory and Eternal Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs; and you be not only enter'd into poſſeſſion of it, by your Faith and Hope, but you begin already to enjoy it, and its Firſt-Fruits, for he that believes in Jeſus Chriſt, is paſt from Death to Life; and whoſoever hath the Son of God, hath Eternal Life. As the Prophet <hi>Moſes,</hi> when he was in the Wilderneſs, did not only ſee afar off the <hi>Land of Promiſe,</hi> but he taſted of its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious Fruits; Thus we don't only behold afar off with the Eye of Faith, our Celeſtial Inheritance, but we taſte at preſent, and reliſh ſome of its bleſſed Delights. And as the Fruits brought by the Spies, were the ſame and like unto them that the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> did eat in the <hi>Promiſed Land;</hi> In like manner, the Fruits that we reliſh in the Wilderneſs of this World, are Fruits of the Tree of Life, with which we ſhall be fully ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in Heaven; for the Grace that God beſtows up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us here below by his Divine Spirit, is the beginning of the Glory, with which he ſhall Crown us above. The ſame Light that ſhines upon our Souls on Earth, ſhall ſhine much more for ever in Heaven. But whereas we look upon it at preſent as it were, through a black miſt with much imperfection, then we ſhall ſee it clearly without Vail or Darkneſs. The ſame Holineſs that adorns, at preſent, our Souls ſhall be their Ornament and Glory, then it ſhall appear without ſpot or blemiſh. That ſame peace of Conſcience that preſerves our Hearts and Sences, ſhall Crown us above, it ſhall be without the leaſt diſturbance. In ſhort, the ſame Jeſus that is conceived in our Hearts, and that is formed, and grows in us by degrees, ſhall then appear in a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Stature, that ſhall want no more increaſe.</p>

               <p>O <hi>Mighty and Merciful Lord, who art the Son of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, and the Fountain of Living Water, drive away from me the dark ſhadows of death, and quench all the Fires that it kindles in my Soul; thou art not only dead for me, but thou art pleaſed to live in me, that I might one day live for ever with thee. Thou haſt of thy pure Mercy choſen me for thy Child, and haſt made me a Member of thy Myſtical Body, Fleſh of thy Fleſh, Bone of thy Bone, and cauſed me to be partaker of thine Holy Spirit. God hath not given thee the Spirit by meaſure, that out of thy fulneſs we might receive Grace for Grace. By the means of this Bleſſed and Infinite Spirit that reſts in my Soul, I am united unto thee in a more perfect man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, than the Tree is to the root that bears it, or the Child to its Mother that nouriſheth it in her Womb, or the Members of the Humane Body, to the Head that gives them Life. The Ties that unite me unto thee; O Glorious Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, are more unchangeable than the Heavens and the Earth. As nothing can pluck me out of thine Hands, there is nothing can ſeparate me from thine Heart. Whether I live or dye, I am thine, my Lord and my God, and nothing can alter thine affection for me. Death can take me out of the World, and carry me out of the embraces of my deareſt friends; but it can never ſeparate me from thine Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, the Soul of my Soul, and the Light of my Life, which cannot be put out by all the envious Blaſts and Storms of the Prince of Darkneſs; this Holy Spirit will bring me to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold

To whom Lord ſhall I go? thou haſt the words of Eternal life, and thou art the inexhauſible Fountain; Thou art my Hope and my Treaſure, my Glory, and mine only Happineſs. O faithful and unqueſtionable Witneſs, I ſhould be worſe than an Infidel, if I did call in queſtion my future Salvation and Glory, ſeeing the Father hath not ſpared thee for me, although thou art his only and beloved Son, the brightneſs of his Glory, and the expreſs Image of his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.

O Glorious Spirit of my Saviour, that reſts upon me; when I ſhould be able to ſpeak the Language of Angels, I could not ſufficiently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the wonderful operations that thou doſt produce in my Soul: thou kindleſt in me ſuch Heavenly Flames as never go out, but are always alive, as the fire of thine Altar; Thou formeſt in me a white Stone, where a new Name is written, which no man knows, but he that receives it; Thou giveſt me to eat of that hidden Manna, of that food of Angels that the World knoweth not: Thou witneſſeſt with my Spirit, that I am a Child of God, an Heir of God, and a Joynt Heir with Jeſus Chriſt, the King of Kings. Thou doſt not only Seal unto me the pardon of all my Sins, but thou doſt alſo purify my Conſcience from all dead Works to ſerve the living God; Thou cauſeſt me to cry out</hi> Abba Father, <hi>and imprint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt in my Heart, the Glorious Image of my Heavenly Father; Thou art the Seal of my Adoption, the earneſt of mine un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruptible Inheritance prepared for me in Heaven; Thou haſt given me the infallible aſſurances of a Glorious and Eternal Life, and begun it already in my Soul, granting to me its Firſt-Fruits; Thou cauſeſt me to behold the Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhine of thy Grace, and makeſt it to give Light in mine <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding; Thou doſt not only vouchſafe unto me, the

At preſent, in my painful paſſage through this Valley of Tears, in the midſt of my Groans and Tears, I may gather ſome Herbs, but when I ſhall come to my Heavenly Countrey, I ſhall reap my Hands full with Songs of Joy. Here upon Earth I ſee God as in a Glaſs obſcurely, but in Heaven I ſhall behold him face to face, and I ſhall be ſatisfied with his likeneſs.

               <p>
                  <hi>The eighth Conſolation is to conſider, that Death frees and delivers us from all the Evils that are in the World, and that we daily ſuffer.</hi>
               </p>
            </argument>
            <p>THere are certain Pictures with two Faces, the one repreſents moſt ugly Features, and the other, beautiful and pleaſant things; This is the true Emblem of Death, for it may be painted with a fearful Face, a lean Body, and iron Hands, that ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh from us our Goods and our Honors, and that divide our Perſons, dragging our bodies into a loathſome Sepulchre; If we look upon Death in this manner, we can do nothing leſs, but tremble and fear; We may alſo look upon it as a powerful Deliverer, that unlooſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:41646:185" rendition="simple:additions"/>all our Fetters, breaks our Chains to pieces, lifts up our Souls to the higheſt Glory and Happineſs; If we conſider thus, there is nothing more lovely than death, and nothing more to be deſired.</p>
            <p>I have hitherto endeavoured to ſhew how a Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſhall ſtrengthen and comfort himſelf againſt the fears of Death, but now I ſhall ſay ſomething more; with Heavens aſſiſtance, I ſhall labor to prove, not only, that Death is to be expected without apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, but to be received with an Holy Joy; That it is not at all dreadful, but rather it is to be earneſtly deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; I ſhall no longer give, to ſpeak right, any Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolations againſt the fears of Death, for I hope to make it plain, that Death it ſelf is to be looked upon as the greateſt Conſolation and Comforter,</p>
            <p>That I may attain unto mine end, I ſhall ſhew as in a Picture, a ſhort view of all the dreadful miſeries, of which Death delivers us, and then I ſhall endeavour to paint out in the brighteſt Colours; or rather I ſhall chaulk out unto you, the Bleſſedneſs and Glories, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which it uſhers us.</p>
            <p>Man's Life and Miſery, are Twin-Siſters, that are born at the ſame time, and owned <hi>Adam</hi> for their Firſt Father; they dye together at the ſame inſtant in true Believers, We all know that Man begins his Life weeping and crying, and ends it with ſighs and Groans; We come into the World all covered with Bloud, and we go out wet all over with a cold Sweat. If the Child cries not, aſſoon as it is born, we judge that it is dead, and when the ſick Body ceaſeth to groan and ſigh, we ſay that he is paſt hopes, ſo that as our crying is a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of Life, likewiſe is and the end of thy ſighs, an in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fallible ſigne of thy Death; Wretched Man! how miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable is thy condition? thy beſt friends rejoyce at thy crying, and they weep and lament, when thou ceaſeſt to ſigh and groan.</p>
            <pb n="377" facs="tcp:41646:185" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p>All the reſt of thy time between thy Cradle and thy Grave is no happier; it is but a continued Chain of Miſery, a mixture of pains, a ſucceſſion of evils, and a Sea of bitterneſs, As one Wave falls upon the back of another, one evil is no ſooner gone, but ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther meets and threatens us, one depth calleth ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and all manner of Flouds and Storms paſs over our Heads, <hi>Job</hi> 5. As the Sparks rife out of the Fire to fly up and down, Man is born for Miſery and Pain; and as the wiſeſt of Kings ſpeaks, <hi>His days are nothing but pain, and his employment but trouble, in the night his Heart reſteth not,</hi> Eccleſ. 3, There are ſcarce any dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, but Meſſengers of ill news do ſometimes come to them, as they did to that of <hi>Job, Job.</hi> 1.</p>
            <p>By God's unchangeable order and appointment, the days ſucceed the nights, and divide the year into two equal parts; for if the nights are longer in one ſeaſon, ſo much the ſhorter are they in another; but the nights of our afflictions are ſo long, that they ſeem to laſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Ages; whereas the days of our proſperity are ſo ſhort, that they are gone in a moment, ſo that we may juſtly ſay with the Prophet <hi>Moſes, The beſt of our days are but labour and ſorrow, ſo ſoon doth our life paſs away, and we are gone,</hi> Pſal. 90. It is as eaſy a taske to num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the Stars of the Firmament, and to reckon up the grains of Sand upon the Sea ſhore, as to make an exact enumeration of all the evils, that happen to us as Men belonging to a civil Society, or as Members of God's and Church, his adopted Children; therefore old <hi>Jacob</hi> had cauſe to complain that the years of his life had been ſhort, and evil, but ours are ſo evil, that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be too ſhort.</p>
            <p>I ſhould compoſe many Volumes, if I ſhould under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take to deſcribe perfectly all the infirmities and diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes that undermine the Body, all the cutting pains, and cruel tortures that torment and rack us.</p>

            <p>The moſt languiſhing ſickneſſes, and the moſt vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent pains that afflict and diſturb this poor Body, are nothing, in compariſon of the exceſſive ſadneſs and mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal anguiſh that ſeize upon our Souls, and fill them full of Gall and Bitterneſs. I think that there is no man up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Earth, that can boaſt of having paſs'd but one day without ſome diſpleaſure, either inward or outward; for we either feel preſent evils that ſtrike through our Hearts, as ſo many Darts, or the remembeance of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Griefs, that trouble us, or elſe the fear of future miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chances vex and fret us; I may juſtly ſay, that the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil is not ſo cruel to himſelf, as we are to our own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, for this evil Spirit cares not to be tormented be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the time, whereas we anticipate the evils, by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet apprehenſions, and wilful vexations entertained in our mind. The fear of Miſery makes us far more miſerable, and the apprehenſion of an imaginary evil, cauſeth us to reſent a real affliction, and an unfeigned torment.</p>
            <p>When we conſider any Mans Life, we only look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that which appears moſt delightful and pleaſant; we conſider the Nobility of his Bloud, the variety of his Pleaſures, the greatneſs of his Riches, the glory of his Offices and Victories, and the pomp of his Triumphs; but ſcarce is there any man that takes notice of his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries and afflictions; or if ſome be noted, they are but ſuch as are too obvious to every man's Eye; as the publick affronts and diſgraces, the loſs of a Battel, the degradation from an Office, Baniſhments, Impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and ſuch like unhappy afflictions; but beſides theſe calamities which are viſible to all the World, and the common motives of the condoling lamentations of our friends; there are many ſecret evils that be far more painful; our deareſt Relations diſcover not always our moſt ſenſible wounds, to pour into them an heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Balm; they ſeek not into our deepeſt ſorrows, nor
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:41646:186" rendition="simple:additions"/>do they dream of applying, to our ſouls, the moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Comforts.</p>
            <p>When ye behold Stage-Players capring upon a Thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre, ſpeaking as big as Kings and Princes, you ſeldom think, that under their Magnificent and Glorious Attire, they hide many filthy Rags, and perhaps ſome incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious Vermin that ſtings them to the quick.

            <p>As Poverty and a mean Eſtate are always accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with a grievous Train of fretful ſorrows and cares, Likewiſe; Riches and Honors are never with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Fears and Diſturbances; and as there is no Flame never ſo pure, but ſends up a Smoak; nor a Roſe ſo beautiful, but hath its prickles; ſo there is no conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the World, ſo beautiful and glorious, nor any proſperity ſo well flouriſhing, but hath its troubles and ſharp Thorns.

The richeſt Crowns caſt all their ſplendor and glory outwardly, but inwardly they are felt to be weighty upon the Heads of ſuch as bear them. A great Prince found his Diadem ſo burdenſom, and unſufferable, that he cried out, <hi>O Crown! if thy weight were well known, none would lift thee up from the ground,</hi> It is not without good cauſe, that ſuch as are paſſionate for the World, and inclinable to the delights of the Fleſh, are in a continual fear and dread, for they be expoſed to moſt imminent dangers; if their Eyes were but open, they ſhould ſee a naked Sword always hanging by a ſmall thread over their Heads. As in that glorious Statue which <hi>Nebuchadnezar</hi> ſaw in his dream, the Head that was of pure Gold, was as eaſily broken, as the Earthen feet, and became as light as Chaff, which the Wind carries away. Likewiſe, the moſt Honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, the Richeſt, and the moſt Glorious Eſtate, is as well ſubject to the ſame miſchances, as the Loweſt, the Pooreſt, and the moſt Wretched; where are any Riches and Treaſuries that are not ſucceeded by Poverty?

<pb n="381" facs="tcp:41646:187" rendition="simple:additions"/>with ſorrow; Therefore when the moſt experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced of all former Princes, had taken an exact notice of all things under the Sun, and taſted of all the delights of Life, he concludes with this confeſſion, <hi>That all things under the Sun are nothing but vanity and vexation of Spirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is not needful that I ſhould make here an exact, and a particular deſcription of all the ſad and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome accidents of this life, that are able to turn the moſt flouriſhing Eſtate upſide-down. Remember, ingenious Reader, to run over carefully the whole courſe of thy life, and examine in the juſt Seales of the Sanctuary, all the good and evil things which thou haſt found by experience. In one put all the ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of thy Fleſh, and whatſoever brings thee any ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage or content; and put in the other all thy fret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Cares, Griefs, Diſpleaſures, and Diſgraces. If thy Evils and Miſeries do not weigh down the Ballance, thou mayeſt eſteem it a wonder and a miracle. Thou haſt no cauſe to boaſt of thine Earthly Happineſs. Mind well the ſpeech of <hi>Solon,</hi> one of the ſeven Wiſe Men of <hi>Greece,</hi> to <hi>Creſus,</hi> a Prince who prided in his Riches and Proſperity, <hi>That none could be eſteemed hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, before his latter end, and the hour of his death.</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, that ſome who have attained to a greater degree of Happineſs, then thou haſt, have fallen into a moſt wretched Eſtate on a ſuddain. He that did lately ſwim in Wealth and Plenty, is reduc'd oft-times to the loweſt Poverty. He that had whole Armies at his Command, is ſometimes forſaken of all the World. He that had Princes for his Subjects, is often forced to obeya Slave. Some that fed daintily, are glad to eat at preſent the Bread of Affliction, and to quench their thirſt with tears. Some that lately flouriſhed in gorgeous Apparel, in Palaces bedecked with Gold and Silver, are now rotting in a loathſome Dungeon. Some are dragg'd from their moſt glorious Dwellings, to the moſt
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:41646:188" rendition="simple:additions"/>infamous Deaths. The richeſt and nobleſt Crowns have not protected the wiſeſt Heads.</p>
            <p>When it ſhould be poſſible to go through this life without feeling any alteration in thine health, nor ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering any loſs of Goods, nor change of thy happy condition, which is as rare a thing to be found, as the ſtrange Bird called a <hi>Phenix.</hi> Haſt thou no Children, Parents, nor Friends whom thou loveſt, or oughteſt to love tenderly? are thoſe Perſons without any afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? and is it not poſſible that it ſhould ſeize upon them? certainly, unleſs thou haſt an Heart as unſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as the Marble and the Steel; unleſs thou haſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced all natural affections, thou muſt needs be moved with theſe evils and diſgraces that happen to them in their life; and when death ſnatcheth them away, it muſt needs tear thy very Heart, and rent thy Bowels.</p>
            <p>But if it ſhould happen, which is not to be believed, that nothing hath ever afflicted thee in thine own Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, or in that of thy Friends; and if all ſuch as are related to thee, live in a perfect and flouriſhing proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity, like unto thoſe Countreys of the other World, that are always covered with Flowers and Fruits; caſt thine Eyes upon the Earth, and thou ſhalt there behold ſo many evils and calamities, that if thou haſt any common ſence of Humanity, thou ſhalt have cauſe to weep. God commanded the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver the Cup of his Wrath to ſeveral People, one af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter another, but now, it ſeems, that he delivers this Cup to them all at once; for where is that People or Nation that may boaſt of never having drunk of it, and of not being in danger of drinking; ſome have drunk it up to the very dregs, others drink it by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees; others have this bitter Cup brought to their Lips.</p>
            <p>Our Saviour cauſed his beloved Diſciple to ſee two Angels, that had each of them in his hand a ſharp
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:41646:188" rendition="simple:additions"/>Sickle to reap the Corn, and gather the Grapes. <hi>Revel.</hi> 14. Afterwards he diſcover'd to him ſeven more, that had in their Hands Golden Viols, full of the wrath of God, which they poured upon the Inhabitants of the World, to plague and puniſh them, <hi>Revel.</hi> 15. But at preſent, the Holy Angels appear in Troops and Legions, to cut off Mankind, and to tranſport them to the Wine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs of God's Eternal Vengeance. The wrath of God ſeems no more to be meaſured out by Viols, nor by Cups, but it appears as a great River, and a bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomleſs Sea, that ſwels, and runs over the Shore and the Banks. In ſhort, the deluge of Evils that covers the face of the Earth, is ſo univerſal, that the Doves, I mean the innocent and meek Souls that love Peace and Reſt, can find no place to fix and ſettle their Feet.</p>
            <p>If thou haſt any Chriſtian Zeal and Charity to aſſiſt thy Sence of Humanity; thou canſt not poſſibly behold with unconcern'd Affections, the deſpicable and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Eſtate of Chriſt's Church on Earth; for it is like <hi>Noah</hi>'s Ark in the midſt of the roaring Waves; Like the burning Buſh of Mount <hi>Oreb,</hi> ſurrounded with Flames; Like the Prophet <hi>Daniel</hi> in the Lion's Den, and like his companions in the fiery Furnace, ſo that it may juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpeak in the ſame manner as the antient <hi>Jeruſalem, Is it nothing to you, all ye that paſs by? behold and ſee, if there be any ſorrow like unto my ſorrow which is done unto me, wherewith the Lord hath afflicted me in the day of his fierce anger,</hi> Lam. 1. O Bleſſed Church of God, thou haſt felt perſecution from thine Infancy, until now, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. Prepare therefore thy ſelf to ſuffer much more in this decay, and old age of the World, for the Devil will perſecute thee with ſo much the more fury and violence, becauſe he knows that he hath but a ſhort time, and that he muſt be ſoon ſhut up in the Lake of Fire and Brimſtone.</p>
            <p>In this caſe, Grief is not only lawful, but commanded, for God requires us to put on Sackcloth and Aſhes, <hi>Iſ.</hi> 12.
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:41646:189" rendition="simple:additions"/>He deſires that we ſhould be ſick for the troubles of <hi>Joſeph, Amos</hi> 6. That we ſhould weep with them that weep, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. That we ſhould remember the priſoners, as if we were priſoners with them, and that we ſhould ſuffer with them that are tormented, as being members of one Body, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. We have good reaſon to apply to the World, and to the Worldlings, <hi>David</hi>'s ſaying, <hi>Wo is me that I ſojourn in Meſech, that I dwell in the Tents of Kedar, my Soul hath long dwelt with him that hateth peace,</hi> Pſal. 120. <hi>Jeremiah</hi> had never ſo much cauſe as we to lament, and to wiſh that his Head were diſſolved into Water, his Eyes were a fountain of Tears to weep day and night, <hi>Jer.</hi> 9. And the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> had never ſo much reaſon to cry out in the diſpleaſure of his Soul, <hi>Look away from me, I will weep bitterly, labour not to comfort me, becauſe of the ſpoiling of the Daughter of my People,</hi> Iſ. 22.</p>
            <p>It is not therefore without good cauſe, that the Preacher acquaints us, <hi>That the day of Death is far bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than the day of our birth;</hi> for our Birth cauſeth us to weep, and Death wipes off all Tears from our Eyes; our Birth diſcovers that large Theatre upon which, all Worldly Tragedies are acted; Death draws the Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, puts a period to all ſuch bloudy Spectacles; Our Birth caſts us into the Fire and Water of divers afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and Death draws us out of the Flames and Bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Finally, ſeeing that our Life is but a Chain of Mi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſery, and that Death breaks in pieces the laſt link; ſeeing that our Life is but a continual Fighting, and that death alone is the Victory; It is moſt certain, that this death is not to be feared as an evil and an enemy, but it is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be deſired as a good Friend, and a Bleſſing. It is reported of the <hi>Thracians,</hi> that they buried their dead with expreſſions of joy; and the Inhabitants of the fortunate Iſlands did Sing and Dance at the Fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals of their deareſt Friends. I don't recommend theſe fooliſh examples of theſe extravagant and barbarous
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:41646:189" rendition="simple:additions"/>People, who were without Hope, and without God in the World; ſuch cannot fear death too much, for if it frees them from ſome preſent and light evils, it caſts them into an Abyſſe of exceſſive torments; Death is an Happineſs, it brings with it ſolid Comfort and Joy, but it is when we dye in God's Favour, and in the Faith of our Lord Jeſus; God hath ſufficiently declared the Happineſs and Pleaſure of his Childrens death, for he doth often abridge the days of thoſe whom he favours and eſteems. Becauſe he had ſeen ſome good things in the perſon of <hi>Abijah,</hi> the eldeſt Son of <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> King of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> he took him away in the flower of his Age, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 14. He granted the ſame favour to <hi>Joſias,</hi> King of <hi>Judea,</hi> one of the moſt Religious Princes of the World, for he had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to him by <hi>Hulda</hi> the Propheteſs, <hi>Behold, I will gather thee unto thy Fathers, and thou ſhalt be gathered into thy Grave in peace, and thine eyes ſhall not ſee all the evil which I will bring upon this place,</hi> 2 Kings 22. It is not to be doubted, but that ſuch are moſt happy, as die in the Lord, and reſt from their Labours; but I judge ſuch happy in a twofold manner, as Dye, or rather ceaſe from Dying in ſuch miſerable times, ſo full of confuſion and diſorder.</p>
            <p>Would not you laugh at a Workman that ſhould grieve when his Task is ended, and his Labour finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; or at a Wayfaring Man, that ſhould lament to ſee the end of his painful journey through Prickles and Thorns, and the ſcorching heat of the Sun, or the unſufferable cold of the Winter. Or would you not wonder at one that ſhould vex himſelf, when he is ſafely arrived in the Haven, eſcaped the Waves of a tempeſtuous Sea, and in a ſhelter from the Storms. Wretched Man! thou art far more fooliſh and extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant, than thoſe of whom we ſpeak; for the moſt painful Labours of a Workman, the moſt grievous wearineſs of a tedious journey, and the ſwelling Waves
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:41646:190" rendition="simple:additions"/>of a troubled Sea, are nothing in compariſon of the Labours, Miſery, and Troubles of this languiſhing Life. You would, doubtleſs, eſteem it a very great fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and madneſs in a priſoner, to be ſorry of being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered out of his noiſome Dungeon; or in a Gally-Slave, to be angry when he is to be loos'd from his Chains; or in an offender, to vex when he is freed from his Torments. What think ye? is there leſs mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and extravagancy in you, when ye are grieved to ſee death, freeing your Souls from this miſerable Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, where it is impriſon'd, withdrawing it from the painful employments of this unhappy Age, more grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous and intolerable than that of the Gally-ſlaves, and diſcharging you from the troubles of the Soul, far more painful, than the moſt unſufferable tortures of the Body; no, no, death that thou dreadeſt ſo much, is not the death of the faithful, but the end of his miſeries, and the laſt period of all his torments, <hi>Gen.</hi> 8. <hi>Noah</hi> when he went out of the Ark that ſtopt upon Mount <hi>Ararat,</hi> had never ſo much cauſe to praiſe God, and to offer unto him the Sacrifice of Thanksgiving; as we have, when he is pleaſed to cauſe us to ſee the end of the Inundation of ſo many evils and calamities, and to make this floating Life, or this living Death, to ſtop upon Mount <hi>Sion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſung Songs of Thankſgiving, when they came out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and ſaw themſelves de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd out of a bitter and painful Bondage; where they had been employed in gathering up Stubble, and burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Brick; but we have much more cauſe to rejoyce and to ſing Songs of Praiſe, when Death takes us out of the World, where we ſuffer a kind of bondage, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boring in vain employments, and enduring the ſcorch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heat of many afflictions that conſume us. Thou findeſt fault with ſome of the unconſtant people that murmured to return again into <hi>Egypt,</hi> when they were upon the borders of the promiſed Land, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:41646:190" rendition="simple:additions"/>find fault with thine own filthy fleſh; if it of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers to murmure and revolt, when thou art at the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of thy Celeſtial <hi>Canaan; Joſeph</hi> rejoyced when the King of <hi>Aegypt</hi> ſent for him out of priſon, <hi>Gen.</hi> 41. and have we not cauſe to be joyful, when God ſends for our Souls out of the World, and cauſeth them to go out of their Bodies, which to them is a kind of a Dungeon?</p>
            <p>If therefore we can ſpeak without impatient mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring; I conceive we have as good reaſon as <hi>Jonas,</hi> to ſay, <hi>O Lord, take, I beſeech thee, my life from me, for it is better for me to dye than to live,</hi> Jonas 4. Or, as the Prophet <hi>Elias, It is enough, Lord, take away my life.</hi> 1 Kings 19.

Let me never forget the ſad and lamentable ſtate of thy poor Church, that is like a ſmall Boat upon the Waves of the Sea, always in danger of ſinking; if thou didſt not ſtill the Winds, and Command the roaring Storms; it is in the

O my God, when wilt, thou ſhut mine Eyes, that I may not ſee ſo many Tragical appearances. When wilt thou ſtretch out unto me from above thine Hand, to draw me out of this Abyſſe of Wickedneſs? When wilt thou ſend down unto me thine Holy Angels, to carry me out of this grievous burning? When is it that I ſhall ſee no more the Nations drunk with the Wine of thy Fury; and thy Holy Church ſtooping under the heavy weight of its Croſs? When ſhall I hear no more the bitter com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints of thy Spouſe; the lamentations of thy Children, the groans of thy Servants, the ſighs of the Priſoners, and the mournings of thine Inheritance. O Heavenly Father, my only Hope, and my All! When wilt thou looſe me from this Chain of Miſery? When wilt thou carry me above the reach of the Storms and Tempeſts of this troubleſom Sea? When ſhall the cares and griefs ceaſe to devour my Soul, and when ſhall my Body no more be ſubject to Sickneſs and Pain, and Torments. O Lord, thou knownſt all things; thou ſeeſt that I am in the World as in a Priſon, and that my Soul is in this wretched Body, as in a woful Dungeon.

The Emblem of that Holy Prudence that this example recommends to poſterity; The cauſe of this unhappy Womans breaking the Angels expreſs Command, was her conſideration of the Riches, Plenty, and Pleaſures of that Countrey which ſhe had left, not thinking upon the baſeneſs, filth, and abominable Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that brought God's Wrath and Vengeance upon the unworthy Inhabitants: Likewiſe, when God intends to take us out of the World, and to ſecure us from the ſence of his dreadful judgements; that which cauſeth us to look back, and hinders us from following the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels that God ſends unto us, to lead us up to the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of our Salvation; are our thoughts and affections for the Riches, Honors, and Pleaſures of this wretched World, whereas we ſhould then fix our minds upon the ſins that govern here below, wherewith we are defiled, whilſt we remain in this corrupted Fleſh.</p>
            <p>Chriſtian Souls, will you prepare your ſelves to go to God? and do you wiſh that Death would comfort and rejoyce your Hearts, inſtead of afflicting them. Caſt your Eyes upon thoſe dreadful Vices that are ſo uſual, under which, the whole Creation groans, as under an
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:41646:193" rendition="simple:additions"/>heavy burden. O good God, in what age are we born? an age like that of <hi>Noah,</hi> for all the Earth hath corrupted its ways, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6. nothing but a deluge of Fire is able to purge it.

Therefore we have good cauſe to make <hi>David</hi>'s Prayer, <hi>Help Lord, for the Godly man ceaſeth, for the faithful fail from among the Children of Men.

O wicked World, a World overflowing with Iniquity, a ſink of Impurity, a burning Furnace, heated with the impure flames of the bottomleſs Pit, and choakt with the ſmoak of Hell. But ſin reigns not only in this wretched World, but it defaces alſo the Church of God, and cauſeth moſt fearful diſorders amongſt thoſe that bear the Glorious name of <hi>Chriſtians;</hi> they were anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently to be diſcerned from the reſt of the World, by their Speech, Converſation, and Behaviour; but the Devil hath wonderfully debauched them, he hath blotted out God's Image in their Souls, he hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from them that noble diſtinction, and removed far away all difference between them and the World; we cannot with juſtice ſay to moſt Chriſtians of our age, as was ſaid to the Apoſtle <hi>St. Peter, Thy ſpeech bewrayeth thee.</hi> Nor to appropriate to them, what <hi>Iſaac</hi> ſaid of one of his Sons, <hi>Thy voice is the voice of</hi> Jacob, <hi>but thou haſt the hands of</hi> Eſau; for they have both the Voice and Hands of prophane <hi>Eſau,</hi> they ſpeak and live as he did, they publiſh their crimes with a
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:41646:193" rendition="simple:additions"/>brazen face, and endeavour to glory in their ſhame; the Air is infected with their prophane and dirty Language, with their impudent Lying, with their fearful Oaths, and grievous Blaſphemies, and the Earth is defiled with their horrid Sins, and abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Crimes. Covetouſneſs, Ambition, Luſt, and all manner of Vices, have mounted upon the Throne; they Act and Command in a furious manner in every place; They that have in their mouths the Holy Name of the Lord Jeſus, and that make profeſſion of fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing his Sacred Footſteps, give us good cauſe to take up again <hi>St. Paul</hi>'s lamentation and complaint, <hi>Many walk, of whom I have told you often, and now tell you even weeping, that they are the enemies of the Croſs of Chriſt, whoſe end is deſtruction, whoſe God is their bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and whoſe glory is in their ſhame, who mind earthly things,</hi> Phil. 3.</p>

            <p>In the midſt of ſuch a woful Corruption, who of us doth afflict his Soul, as Righteous <hi>Lot?</hi> who weeps day and night, as <hi>David,</hi> a Man after God's own Heart? where can we ſpy out the Fountains of Tears of the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah?</hi> Or the confuſion of Face of <hi>Daniel?</hi> Or the Zeal of <hi>Moſes,</hi> of <hi>Phineas,</hi> and of <hi>St. Paul?</hi> If the Angel of God that went

            <p>But we are ſo far from grieving at the univerſal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>undation of Vice in the World, that we our ſelves are carried away with the impetuous torrent of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption.

The Men of the World have an eaſier taske to teach us their Vices, than we have to teach and perſwade them to Vertue. As a peſtiferous Body may ſpread the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and give it to a thouſand ſuch as are whole; whereas, a thouſand in perfect health cannot heal one infected with the Plague. So that what hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened under the Ceremonial Law, happens now un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us; the clean Veſſel did not ſanctify the defiled, but the defiled did corrupt, by its approaches, ſuch as were clean. Evil companies corrupt good man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and the flames of the moſt burning Zeal, are extinguiſh'd by the coldneſs of the Age. As Lambs cannot feed amongſt Bryars and Thorns, without leaving behind them ſome of their Wooll; Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the harmleſs and meek Souls, cannot live a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt ſo much couſenage and malice without looſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:41646:194" rendition="simple:additions"/>ſomething of their Innocency and Chriſtian Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity.</p>
            <p>Who is it amongſt us, that can ſay, with a ſafe Conſcience, that the World is crucrified to him, and that he is crucified to the World? <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. Or who is it that lives in the World without being guilty of its ſins, as the Fiſh drinks of the Sea water and receives nothing of its bitterneſs? <hi>Pſal.</hi> 26. Who can converſe in the Courts of Princes, as <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph</hi> in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> as <hi>Daniel</hi> in <hi>Babylon,</hi> or as Queen <hi>Eſther</hi> in the Court of <hi>Ahaſuerus?</hi> Is there any that can juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſay, that he hath waſhed his Hands in Innocency, and purified his Conſcience from all dead Works, to ſerve the living God? <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. Who can ſpeak in this manner, <hi>I have purified my Heart, I am clean from my ſin? Prov.</hi> 20. In truth, if we ſay that we have no ſin, we deceive our ſelves, and the Truth is not in us. 1 Joh. 1. We have good reaſon to break out in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi>'s exclamation, when he ſaw God ſitting upon his Throne, <hi>Wo is me, for I am undone, becauſe I am a man of unclean Lips, and I dwell in the midſt of a People of unclean Lips,</hi> Iſai. 6. Or we may ſay with the ſame Prophet <hi>From the ſole of the foot, unto the crown of the head, there is no whole part.</hi> Not only the Souls that are fixed to the Earth, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo ſuch as mount up to Heaven by fervent Prayers, and devout Meditations, have good cauſe to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge their imperfections, and to ask forgiveneſs. If any fancies himſelf to be perfectly whole and free from all infection, let him enter into his Soul, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly examine his own Conſcience, and the ſame thing will happen to him as to <hi>Moſes,</hi> when he put his hand into his boſom, he drawed it out again as white as Snow, all covered with Leproſie, <hi>Exod.</hi> 4. Where is there a Chriſtian that feels no Law com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding in his Members, and ſtrugling againſt the Law of his Underſtanding? Who is it that finds not
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:41646:195" rendition="simple:additions"/>by experience, the truth of <hi>St. Paul's</hi> ſaying? <hi>The fleſh luſteth againſt the ſpirit, and the ſpirit againſt the fleſh, and theſe are contrary the one to the other, ſo that ye cannot do the things that ye would,</hi> Rom. 7. Gal. 5. Without doubt, ſuch as know not, nor never have felt the bitter and vehement ſtruglings of their car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Luſts that War againſt the Soul, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. cannot conceive what it is to deny themſelves, to put off the old man with his Deeds, to crucify the Fleſh with its Affections and filthy Luſts, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. ſuch know not what it is to mortify our Members, to cut off our right Feet, and right Hands, and to pluck out our right Eyes, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10. that is to ſay, to deſtroy, and by an Holy violence, to give a deadly wound to all our brutiſh Paſſions, and vicious Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, when they ſhould ſeem to us as dear and uſeful as our Hands, Feet, and as tender as our right Eyes, <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 3. <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.</p>
            <p>If theſe curſed affections could but declare their names, they would ſay as the evil Spirits of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, <hi>Our name is Legion, for we are many.</hi> As that De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil that poſſeſſed the Lunatick, mentioned by <hi>St. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew,</hi> he caſt him ſometimes into the Fire, at other times into the Water. Likewiſe theſe carnal Luſts labour to caſt us ſometimes into the Flames of Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, or into the burning heat of Covetouſneſs, or to hurry us headlong into the gulf of unlawful Delights, or into the mud of filthy and carnal Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures. Furthermore, they break the Chains and Ties with which we imagine to ſtop their fury; they war and fight againſt us by day and by night; and at every moment they return to charge us home, and renew the combate. Every where they aſſault us, and have no more regard for Temples and Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of Prayer, than for common and publick places. As Satan had once the boldneſs to encounter with <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoſoua</hi> the High-Prieſt, before the Angel of God;
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:41646:195" rendition="simple:additions"/>Likewiſe theſe curſed Luſts are ſo impudent to tempt us in the moſt Religious Aſſemblies, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouteſt Congregations, as well as where we are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in the moſt helliſh and debauched companies of the World.</p>
            <p>But theſe Luſts that War againſt the Soul, are as ſubtil and malicious, as they are cruel and obſtinate. When they perceive us upon our guards, and ſee that there is nothing to be got, they conceal their wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons, and their fire, but it is with a deſign to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize and burn us when we are leaſt aware. As there are certain Creatures that counterfeit the Dead, that Men might not ſpend their labor to kill them; Likewiſe, this treacherous Fleſh appears of its own accord, as dead, that we might ſpare it, and not total<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deprive it of Life. If then we leave it in peace and quiet, it recovers its ſtrength and vigor, and aſſaults us afreſh with its poiſoned Darts. When we imagine that we have cut up this wretched Plant by the root, it grows and breaks forth into bitterneſs. When we think that we have put out this Fire, with the Tears of our Repentance, it kindles again, and burſts forth into fiercer Flames. Aſſoon as we have cut this cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Serpent to pieces, with the ſharp knife of true Repentance, it gets together, and when it ſeems to have loſt all ſtrength and heat, it recovers again in our Breaſts, and wounds us to the very Heart. In ſhort, as that evil Spirit, mentioned by our Saviour, in the Gospel, when he was driven out of one Houſe, waited for a good opportunity to return; which aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoon as he perceived, he took unto himſelf ſeven o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Spirits, worſe than himſelf, ſo that the laſt conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of that Man was worſe than the firſt, <hi>Mar.</hi> 12. Likewiſe after an afflicting Faſt, and fervent Prayers; after a torrent of contrite Tears; when we imagine that we have caſt out of our Hearts, the moſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Luſts; if we begin to relent and open to
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:41646:196" rendition="simple:additions"/>them the door, they burſt in again upon us with more fury, and render the ſequel of our Life, far more bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and unpleaſant.</p>
            <p>But if you had not ſo many ſins, and that your Luſts were not ſo violent, when the old Man ſhould not have ſo much ſtrength in our Members, and that the temptations ſhould not overcome us ſo often; tell me, I pray, Chriſtian Souls, in what Vertues do you excell? Have they all the Beauty, the Glory, and Perfection that God requires? Is your Holineſs without the leaſt ſpot or blemiſh? Is your Innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy as white as Snow, and as bright as the Light? Is your Zeal as hot and burning as that of the <hi>Sera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phims?</hi> Is your Charity ſincere, without Paint or Diſguiſe, as that of Chriſt, who gave his Life for you? Do you love God for his Name ſake, or becauſe of his excellent Perfection? Do you love him with all your Heart, with all your Strength, and with all your Thoughts? Do you love him more than you love your Selves, or any thing in the World? Do you hate all things that he hates? and do you care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully abſtain from every thing that diſpleaſeth him? Do you love your neighbor in God, and for the ſake of that good God, whoſe Image he bears? Do you love him as you love your Selves, without Hypocriſy or Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe? Do you never deal otherwiſe with others, than you would have them deal with you? And do you per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form to them the ſame good Offices, that you would have them perform to you, if they were in the ſame Eſtate as you be at preſent? Do you ſhine in the midſt of the dark night of this Age, as ſo many Tapers lighted with the beams of the Sun of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs? <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. Do you live as Citizens of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and as fellow-Citizens of the Saints, and as the Children of God? <hi>Phil.</hi> 5. Or as ſuch as expect the Bleſſed Hope, and appearing of the Glory of the Great God and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt? Is your
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:41646:196" rendition="simple:additions"/>Heart in Heaven, where your Treaſure ſhould be, and your Glory and Happineſs. And do you walk as Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that aſcend up by the ſteps and degrees of Piety to the Heavenly <hi>Jeruſalem? Tit.</hi> 2. Do you go from Faith to Faith, from Hope to Hope? and do you make every day ſome new progreſs in Holineſs? Do you never grieve the Holy Spirit, by whom you have been ſealed for the day of Redemption? Are you im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable, abounding always in the Work of the Lord? <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. And do you endeavour to be found in him, without ſpot or blame, in Peace? 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.</p>
            <p>Tell me devout Souls, whether you be not as the Fire and the light. For as there is no Flame ſo pure, but hath its Smoak, nor Star ſo bright, but becomes dark and inviſible at the firſt approach of the Sun; Likewiſe, there is no Life ſo Holy and Harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, but hath its imperfections, and cannot abide the ſight of an impartial God, and the exact inquiſition of his Juſtice. When we have well Prayed and Wept, and begg'd Forgiveneſs; and when God hath beſtowed upon us a new Heart, and a new Spirit; After all, we have need that God ſhould enlighten us afreſh with the Gracious Beams of his Divine Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, that he ſhould lead us by the Hand, direct us by his Wiſdom, and accompliſh his Vertue in our Infirmities.</p>
            <p>Examine ſeriouſly, <hi>My dear Friends,</hi> unto what exerciſes of Devotion you are moſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted, and what ſecret motions you feel in your Souls. Who is it that hath the greateſt ſhare in your Heart and Affections? What Thoughts do lull you aſleep, and what are thoſe that awake you? What do you think upon, for the moſt part, upon God and his Glory, or upon the World and its Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities? upon Heaven and its Excellencies, or upon the Earth and its Riches? upon Paradiſe, and its
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:41646:197" rendition="simple:additions"/>mortal Delights? or upon the Fleſh and its baſe ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactions? And when you meditate upon Divine things, are you certain that you do it with a Religious at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, with an inward delight that raviſheth and comforts your Souls. And when you offer any Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers unto God, do you perform this Duty with Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility and an Holy Zeal? Are your Hearts and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections carried up to Heaven, before you lift up thitherward your Eyes and Hands? Are your Orai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zons like the perfume of the Saints, that came out of Golden Viols? Are they like the Incenſe of the antient Iſraelites that did ſmoak upon an Altar, burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with a Celeſtial Fire? Do they thus proceed from a Soul purified with Faith, which is more precious than fine Gold? Do they come from an Heart that is enflamed with a Zeal that never dies, and that aſcends continually on high? Do you beſtow your Alms with that earneſt and fervent Charity that God requires from you? Do you open your Bowels to your Brethren, before you open to them your Purſe? And do you beſtow your Hearts upon the Poor, before you beſtow your Money?</p>
            <p>And for the publick Devotions that you owe to God; Pray tell me with what Humility and Reſpect they are performed? Do you call your <hi>Delight</hi> the Days dedicated to his Glory, and to the Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration of his Holy Myſteries, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 58. or do you look upon them as troubleſome? Don't they cauſe you to complain in your ſelves, as thoſe prophane Jews ſpoken of by <hi>Malachi, Behold what a wearineſs is it,</hi> Mal. 1. Do you go up to the Houſe of God with the voice of Melody, and tranſports of Joy? <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 41. or do you go thither out of cuſtom, in a careleſs manner? When <hi>Jacob</hi> went up to <hi>Bethel</hi> to offer Sacrifices, he buried under ground, all the Gods of Gold and Silver, that were in his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily,
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:41646:197" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>Gen.</hi> 35. Likewiſe, you Religious Souls, when you intend to go up to Offer your Spiritual Sacrifices in the true <hi>Bethel,</hi> where God beſtows in ſuch plenty his Bread from Heaven, that gives life to the World; Do you not forget to bury all your Earthly Cares, your Carnal Luſts? Or elſe do you nouriſh in your Hearts, all theſe falſe Gods, of whom the World is ſo fond? Do you look upon the Holy Aſſemblies with an unconcerned Eye? Or do you behold them with Reverence and Reſpect, as the living Images of that Glorious Church, gathered together before God's Majeſtique Throne, which worſhips him day and night in his Holy Temple? Are thoſe Divine <hi>Pſalms</hi> that are there, ſung only upon your Tongues, or do you ſing them with your Hearts to the Lord? Do you think upon the Angels Songs, and the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirits Hallelujahs, with Holy tranſports of Joy? Is the Word of God only an Airy Sound that ſtrikes your Ears, or doth it reach your Conſciences? <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 3. Doth not your Heart burn within you, while God ſpeaks by the Miniſtry of his Servants, and opens to you his Holy Scriptures? <hi>Revel.</hi> 19. Doth this Heart of yours burn with an Heavenly Fire, or with reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs impatience, to ſee the end of your Devotions, that you might return to your Domeſtick affairs, to your worldly Delights, or to your carnal paſtimes? <hi>Luk</hi> 14. Doth your Soul thirſt for God, for the ſtrong and living God? <hi>Pſal.</hi> 42. And is the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming of the Holy Will of your Heavenly Father, become your Meat, and your only Delight, <hi>John</hi> 4. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103. In ſhort, Do you fly as ſwift as the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Angels, when your great God and Saviour of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers to you an occaſion of advancing his Kingdom, of comforting his Choſen, and edifying the Souls for whom he is dead? When <hi>Abraham</hi> offered unto God many Beaſts in Sacrifice, a flight of Birds came and
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:41646:198" rendition="simple:additions"/>lighted upon his dead Offerings, <hi>Gen.</hi> 15; Likewiſe, when we preſent unto God the Sacrifices of Praiſe and Thankſgiving, and intend to multiply the acts of our Devotion, a great number of vain and idle thoughts come to interrupt us. <hi>Abraham</hi> frighted away thoſe troubleſom Birds, but it is not always in our power to drive away from our minds theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truding thoughts that diſturb us in our Devotions. When we will lift up our ſelves unto God, and draw near to his Sacred Throne, our Hearts are far more dull and heavy, than ever <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Hands were, ſo that they fall down again to the Earth, and to mind Earthly things; we need therefore that our Chief Prieſt ſhould hold them up; and furthermore, it is neceſſary that they ſhould be perfum'd with the ſweet ſmells of his moſt Holy Sacrifice, <hi>Exod,</hi> 17.</p>
            <p>If <hi>David,</hi> a Man after God's own Heart, intreats that God would be pleaſed to ſanctify the Words of his Mouth, and the Meditations of his Heart, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 15. If the Prophet <hi>Daniel,</hi> whom the Holy Spirit ſtiles, <hi>A man greatly beloved, Dan.</hi> 9. who ſpent the days and the nights in Devotion, ſeeks how to make his Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers acceptable to God, If the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> hath need that his Lips ſhould be purified with a burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Coal taken from the Altar, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 6. Who will wonder if the Meditations of the devouteſt Souls be ſo often in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted? if their Prayers be ſo cold and lukewarm? who can think it ſtrange that we are not able to pray as we ought? <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. And that we have need to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire God's Holy Spirit of Prayer and Supplication, who prays and intercedes for us, with Sighs and Groans which cannot be expreſſed, <hi>Zach.</hi> 13. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.</p>
            <p>That which afflicts moſt the true Believers is, that when they imagine that they have attained to ſome kind of Perfection in the exerciſes of Piety; they find many times, to their unſpeakble ſorrow, that
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:41646:198" rendition="simple:additions"/>they are but beginners, and that they have made no progreſs at all. For as the Stone caſt up into the Air, falls down of its own accord, by reaſon of its natural weight; and as the Water often heated, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes as often cold and frozen, becauſe cold is a property belonging to it; Likewiſe our Souls that mount up to God in Holy Meditations and Zealous Prayers, fall down again to theſe Earthly Vanities, they become cold and heavy, for theſe are their natural Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties. God refuſed the Sacrifices of ſuch Beaſts as were lame and ſickly; if therefore he ſhould treat us, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to our Deſervings, how will he accept of us or our Devotions; we that are weak and infirm in his ſervice, and that cannot walk in his ways without ſtumbling at every moment. For theſe Conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons I may apply to the ſpiritual Joy what was ſaid of the Earthly and worldly mirth, <hi>Joy is cut off by Sadneſs,</hi> Iſai. 65. For when we have felt in our Breaſts this unſpeakable Joy of the Holy Ghoſt, and that it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins afterwards to abate, it ſeems to us, as if it had taken its flight to Heaven, as the ſmoak of <hi>Manoah</hi>'s Sacrifice; Then as great a Sorrow ſeiſeth upon our Souls, therefore we may complain and cry out as David, <hi>Will the Lord caſt me off for ever? and will he be favourable no more? is his Mercy clean gone for ever? doth his promiſe fail for evermore? hath God forgotten to be Gracious? hath he in anger ſhut up his tender Mercies?</hi> Pſal. 77. And pray in the Language of <hi>Iſaiah, Lord awaken thy jealouſie, and the ſtirring of thy Bowels, that are ſhut up to me.</hi> Finally, if after all the exerciſes of Devotion, if after a ſerious and ſetled Meditation up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God's Holy Word: if after Faſting and Mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Prayers and Tears, and a conſtant attendance in the Duties of Religion; we find any good Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs in Piety; we may then alſo perceive Vice to proceed out of our moſt Glorious Vertues, and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecteſt
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:41646:199" rendition="simple:additions"/>Graces. For as the Moth enters ſooneſt into the richeſt Stuffs and Cloth; thus Pride creeps into the nobleſt Souls, and breeds in the moſt enlightened un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings. As a Primitive Doctor of the Chriſtian Church hath very well obſerved; all Vices are begot by corruption, and by other Vices, only Pride and Preſumption proceed from Vertue. O how hard a task is it for a Man enabled with Gifts and Perfections, that raiſe him above the Vulgar, not to be puffed up with Pride, nor deceived with the love of himſelf. As the beautiful Bird looks and admires the dainty and various Colours of its Wings, we do thus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold and admire our ſelves, we are in love with our own Beauty, and idolize our Vertues. Therefore as the Nurſe leaves ſometime the Child to his Legs, and ſuffers it to fall, that it might know its own ſtrength, and learn to hold faſter by the Hand; Thus God withdraws from us the aſſiſtance of his Grace, to humble us, and to cauſe us to implore more earn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtly the help and favourable ſuccors of his Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. When <hi>St. Peter</hi> felt the Sacred Flames of that Holy Zeal that was kindled in his Heart, and that ſincere love that he had for Chriſt; he rejoyced and imagined himſelf to be ſtrong enough to reſiſt all the powers of Hell, and to fruſtrate all the fiery Darts of the Devil. This good opinion that he had of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and of his own ability, tranſports him to that confidence, as to contradict our Saviour Chriſt, and to proteſt; <hi>Although all ſhould be offended in thee, yet will not I be offended; and when I ſhould dye with thee, yet will not I deny thee.</hi> This was he who trembled at the voice of a Damſel, ſo that his Fall and Apoſtacy, was as notable as his Confidence was great; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it warns ſuch as ſtand, that they ſhould take heed of falling into misfortune, <hi>Rom,</hi> 11.</p>
            <pb n="405" facs="tcp:41646:199" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p>There is no good natured Child but is vexed to live amongſt ſuch as Curſe and Reproach its Parents; and if we ſhould happen to be concerned unawares in the offence, or to occaſion the death of him from whom it had its being, it will feel an Eternal diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure. Now it is certain, that whilſt we live in this world, we muſt ſpend our time amongſt thoſe that blaſpheme the Holy Name of God, and abuſe the Glory of his Eternal Godhead. Moreover, Vice and Corruption are ſo univerſal, that we our ſelves offend this Father of Mercies and Compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, we add ſin to ſin, and heap up our iniquities together.</p>
            <p>Let us therefore conclude from hence, Believing Souls, that Death is not to be feared as an Evil, or a Miſery, but that it is rather to be deſired, as an Advantage and a Bleſſing. For ſeeing that it is to be wiſhed for, becauſe it frees us from all the calamities and ſufferings of the World; It is far more deſira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, becauſe it cloſeth our Eyes, and conveys out of our ſight, all the ſins and abominations that abound in the World; and becauſe it ſtops our Ears, and hinders us from hearing the Impieties and the filthy Diſcourſes that infect the Air. Seeing that Death is to be embraced with joy, becauſe it delivers our Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies from the diſeaſes that torment them and our minds from the cares and diſpleaſures that vex and afflict them; It deſerves to be welcomed with great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er expreſſions of Gladneſs, becauſe it delivers us from all remains of ſin, and puts a period to our natural corruption; ſo that it is to be eſteem'd, and look'd upon as the Death and Deſtruction of the Old Man, rather than the Death of a true Believer.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sampſon</hi> rejoyced in his Death, becauſe he knew, that in dying, his mortal Enemies ſhould dye alſo, and be deſtroyed with him; we have more cauſe to
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:41646:200" rendition="simple:additions"/>rejoyce at our Death, and to give God thanks at that time; ſeeing that in dying, or rather in paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from Death to Life, we may ſee the Deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all the dangerous Enemies of our Salvation, Who are more dreadful to us than the Philiſtins were to <hi>Sampſon.</hi> All the moſt cruel and barbarous Men of the World are not ſo much to be feared, as the Luſts of our filthy Fleſh, that put out the Eyes of our underſtanding, that cauſe us to be the Devil's ſport, and to worſhip many falſe Gods.</p>
            <p>We commonly run out with haſte from a place infected with the Plague, and ſhould not we make as much ſpeed by our Vows and Prayers, to get out of the World? ſeeing that Vice is ſo Infectious and Univerſal all over it, that ſo many thouſand Souls are therewith miſerably ſpoiled. Seeing the World is as a <hi>Babylon,</hi> where all manner of Debauchery, Vice and Vertue are mixed together, where Unjuſtice and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety Reigns; have we not greater cauſe to be tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported with Joy, when God delivers us from our wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Captivity, than the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> had when it pleaſed him to call them out of <hi>Babylon?</hi> ſhould we not ſing unto him when the Lord returned back, and reſtored them of <hi>Sion,</hi> that came back from their Captivity; we were as thoſe that dream, though our Mouths were full of Laughter, and our Tongues with Songs of Triumph?</p>
            <p>In ſhort, as the Lord Jeſus, when he had reſtored <hi>Lazarus</hi> to life, and taken him out of his Grave, he had compaſſion of him, and could not ſee him any longer wrapped up in his Winding Sheet, and tied with a Napkin; therefore he commanded, <hi>Looſe him and let him go.</hi> Likewiſe this Merciful Lord, who hath made us to be partakers of the firſt Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and called our Souls out of the noiſom Grave of our Luſts, is moved with compaſſion for us, when
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:41646:200"/>he ſees theſe wretched Souls drag about them the reliques of Sin, and ſome Remains of that Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in which they were wrapped. Therefore he will cauſe them to hear this ſweet and comfortable voice, <hi>Looſe them and let them go.</hi> Let them go to the Eternal Manſions, to the City of the living God, to the Heavenly Jeruſalem, to the Glorious Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of Angels, and to the Church and Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Firſt-born, whoſe Names are Written in Heaven.</p>

               <head>A Prayer and Meditation for a true Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, who comforts himſelf with this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, That Death ſhall deliver him from Sin that Reigns ſo much in the World, and from all Remains of his wretched Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption.</head>

                     </gap> from thy Sanctuary and Compaſſionate my wretched E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate. Thou underſtandeſt well the cauſe of my grief, O Lord, who ſearcheſt the Hearts, and readeſt my moſt Secret Thoughts. Thou knoweſt, O my God, that I grieve to ſee ſo much Injuſtice and Impiety reigning this day in the World, to ſee Vice, Prophaneſs Superſtition and Schiſm, committing ſo many diſorders in thy Holy Church; But that which chiefly increaſeth my pain, and aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vates my diſpleaſure, is to ſee my ſelf guilty and ſpotted with the general corruption, and to feel my Fleſh, war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and ſtrugling againſt the Spirit. The Luſts of the Fleſh do not only diſturb me, but they get many times the victory, and inſult upon my infirmities. Sin ſhews not only it ſelf to me in all its Helliſh deformity, ſo that I am thereby aſhamed of my ſelf, but I alſo acknowledge, to the praiſe of thy Grace, that all that is beſt in me, cannot endure an exact Inquiſition of thy Juſtice. Alas my God, how imperfect is my Piety? How languiſhing is my Devotion? I worſhip thee too much for cuſtom, and in a very ſlight manner. I often praiſe thee with my Tongue, and Honour thee with my Lips, whilſt my Heart is far from thee. The Love that I bear to thee is not pure and
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:41646:201" rendition="simple:additions"/>enflamed, and my Charity, inſtead of being burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, is quite cold, or lukewarm. I have not a ſufficient truſt upon thy promiſes, and upon thy fatherly care, my Hope is not ſetled; It doth not ſill my Soul with Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Joys and Comforts. Thine eyes, O Lord, that ſees all the ſecret Cloſſets of the Heart, and that pierce into the depths, are too Holy and Pure, to paſs over the ſight of evil, and to approve of the ill-favour'd Features of Satan yet imprinted in my Soul; they don't only diſcover my ſins, and iniquities, and all my evil Deeds, but they alſo behold all the ſpots and imperfections of my beſt performances, and of my moſt Glorious Acts. My Lord, and my God, I am not only grieved to ſee ſo much ſin in the World, in the Church, and in my Self, but I am alſo grieved and vexed, that I have not grief enough; That my Soul is not ſufficiently vexed, as that of Righteous</hi> Lot; <hi>That the Zeal of thine Houſe doth not eat me up, as it did the Man after thine own Heart; That mine Eyes are not become a Well-Spring of Tears, as thoſe of the Prophet; That the cares of the Churches do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiege me as they did thine Holy Apoſtle; And that I do not ſigh and cry as the ſervants whom thou didſt mark with the Letter</hi> Thau. <hi>O wonderful Lord! Seeing that thou doſt give me leave, wherefore is it that I do not em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace thee with a lively Faith, and a ſerious Repentance? VVherefore do not I wreſtle with thee by Prayers and Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications, and Tears? and that I continue not in theſe De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions, until I have obtained thy moſt precious Bleſſings, until thou haſt changed my Being, and my Life; until thou haſt renewed my Spirit, and my Heart, to love thee, fear thee, and worſhip thee, anſwerable to thine infinite Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits and Glory? O Lord, I perceive thou haſt not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther forſaken me; I perceive the day of my deliverance breaking in upon me; I ſee Death coming to carry me out of this painful Dwelling, out of this life of bitterneſs and ſorrow: I have this comfort, that it ſhall put to death my
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:41646:202" rendition="simple:additions"/>moſt cruel and unreconcileable Enemies, and introduce me into the freedom of thy Children; It will cut off all the remains of that corruption in which I was firſt conceived, and uſher me into that Eternal Light that ſhines for ever in Heaven; Therefore, inſtead of frighting me, the ſight of Death rejoyceth and comforts my Heart; for this cauſe I ſhall not fly from it, and turn my back, but I ſhall go and meet it; I will endeavour to haſten its coming by my Prayers and continual VViſhes; I will embrace it when thou ſhall be pleaſed to ſend it. O Almighty God of an infinite Goodneſs, when wilt thou reach unto me thy Hand from Heaven, to draw me out of this</hi> Egypt? <hi>that I may no longer ſee the cruelties and abominations committed in it. VVhen wilt thou deliver me out of this</hi> Babylon, <hi>where Vice and Vertue are intermixed, and where the Creature receives the Honor, only due to the Creator? VVhen wilt thou have Compaſſion of my poor Soul that drags yet ſome of its Chains? And when ſhall I hear that ſweet and comforting voice,</hi> Looſe him and let him go to his God who calls him, and to his Saviour who holds out unto him his Arms wide open? <hi>VVhen wilt thou ſend unto me thy good Angels, to lead me up to thine Holy Mountain, to thine Heavenly Jeruſalem, where no impure thing ſhall ever en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; or that committeth Abomination, or a Lye? VVhen ſhall I ſee my ſelf in that bleſſed Paradiſe, where there ſhall be no Serpent to ſeduce us, nor Luſts to war againſt us, nor evil company to corrupt and ſpoil us? VVhen ſhall I behold the new Heavens and the new Earth, where Juſtice, Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and true Holineſs, are ſitting upon the Throne? How long, Lord, ſhall I hear thine Holy Name blaſphemed, and the Bloud of thy Covenant trampled under foot? How long yet ſhall I liſten to the impieties and abuſes of the Children of this age? VVhen wilt thou lift me up to the Dwelling of thy Glory, where I ſhall be no longer aſſaulted with temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from the VVorld, with enticements from the Fleſh, and with the fiery Darts of the Devil, where I ſhall be no more
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:41646:202"/>vexed with evil deſires, falſe Fears, and vain hopes; where I ſhall never offend my God, nor grieve his Holy Spirit, that hath ſealed me to the day of my Redemption. O Holy of Holies! when ſhall thy Church be ſo ſanctified, and cleanſed, that no ſpot or wrinkle, nor any ſuch thing ſhall appear in it? When ſhall I ſee it decked with fine Linnen, cloathed with the Sun, and crowned with the Stars? When ſhall my Heart be as a golden Viol, from whence ſweet Perfumes may aſcend? VVhen ſhall I behold thy Face continually? VVhen ſhall I love thee without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruption, and ſerve thee without any Lett or Hinderance? VVhen wilt thou put into my Hands a Celeſtial Harp, and into my Mouth the Songs of the Bleſſed? and when ſhall I worſhip thee in the company of all the Holy Spirits, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out intermiſſion, and for ever? VVhen ſhall I ſing forth thy Praiſes in Heaven? O Lord, when ſhall I appear with the Holineſs of thy Saints, in the white Robes of thy Martyrs, and be as fiery as the Seraphims that fly about thy Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Throne. O my God! Let this Holy Zeal which thou haſt kindled in my Soul, be like a Fiery Chariot, and an Holy Flame, to carry me up to the Heaven of thy Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, where I am to ſhine in thy preſence for ever,</hi> Amen.</p>

            <head>CHAP. 22. </head>
            <argument>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Tenth Conſolation, is the Glory and Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of our Souls, at their Egreſs out of the Body.</hi>
               </p>
            </argument>
            <p>IF there were neither Puniſhment nor Torment af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this life to be feared; the Wicked and Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers that proſper in the World, might juſtly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem themſelves the happieſt of all men. And if there were neither Glory nor Rewards to be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed after death, the Righteous and the Faithful, who drink, here below, Cups full of bitterneſs and ſorrow, would be the moſt miſerable of all Creatures. The condition of the Beaſts would appear more happy than theirs, for they enjoy in quiet and peace, all the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures that the animal Nature is able to reliſh. They are not tormented by ſo many diſeaſes that vex our Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies; neither do they know the cares and diſpleaſures that conſume and fret our minds; They grieve not for the time paſt, nor trouble themſelves with any ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of the time to come; They never feel the grievous diſputes of Luſts; They know not moſt of thoſe Paſſions that torment and domineer over our Souls. All their pains and ſufferings, end with their breath, ſo that when they are dead, they endure no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. If we make our Eyes the Judges of theſe things; we may ſay, <hi>The accident that happens to Men and Beaſts, is the ſame accident, as is the death of the one ſo is the death of the other.</hi> But if we ſearch and examine further, we ſhall find more difference than between Heaven and Earth, between Light and Darkneſs; for it
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:41646:203" rendition="simple:additions"/>is true, that the death of Beaſts delivers them from the ſenſe of all evils, but it doth not introduce them into any real happineſs; when it puts an end to their Miſery, it puts a period to their Being, and to all that pleaſure and content, which they formerly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed; for their Souls and Bodies die together with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any hopes of living again.</p>
            <p>If we look to the wicked and unbelievers, we ſhall find that death deprives them, not only of their Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors, Riches, and of all their Pleaſures, and carnal En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments; but it puts out their Taper in their black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Darkneſs, and all their greateſt Delights are loſt in a vaſt Sea of bitterneſs. If Death looſeth them from that Chain of Miſery, from which all the Children of <hi>Adam</hi> are unſeparable; if it frees then Bodies from the pain of any temporal evils, it caſts their Souls into Eternal Torments; but for the vertuous and believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chriſtians, if Death is ſo great a friend to them, becauſe it delivers them from many Evils and Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, it is a greater friend, becauſe it opens to them the Gate that leads to an endleſs Glory and Happineſs.</p>
            <p>The Son of God had a deſire to perſwade us this Truth, in that remarkable Parable of the 16 of <hi>St. Lukes</hi> Goſpel, for at one hand he ſhews a rich Miſer, cloathed in Purple and fine Linnen, feeding upon Dainties, and living in much Splendor and Magnificence; and at the other hand he diſcovers to us a poor Wretch, named <hi>Lazarus,</hi> all covered with Soars, lying at this rich mans Gate, intreating that he might ſhare with the Dogs in the Crums that fell from the rich Man's Table: the Dogs had compaſſion upon him, and lick'd his Sores; at laſt, the poor Man dyed, and was carried by the Angels into <hi>Abraham</hi>'s boſom. O wonderful change! He that was lately a companion, ſcarce good enough for Dogs, now ſolaces himſelf in the Angel's Embraces; He that was lying at the Gate of a proud and unmer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:41646:204" rendition="simple:additions"/>Wretch, is admitted into the Glorious Palace of Immortality, and repoſes himſelf in the boſom of a charitable and rich <hi>Abraham,</hi> where he is ſanctified with the Bread of the living God, and drinks of the Rivers of his Pleaſures. The rich Man dyed alſo, but it happened, that while his Body was laid in the Earth with State and Honor, the Devils dragg'd his Soul in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Hell, and caſt it into a Fire that burns continually, and that nothing is able to extinguiſh: Therefore our Saviour repreſents this damned Soul, crying out of Hell fire, <hi>Father</hi> Abraham, <hi>have pity upon me, and ſend</hi> La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus,, <hi>that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my Tongue, for I am tormented in theſe Flames.</hi> In the next Verſes, our Saviour ſhews, how all the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints of the damned are fruitleſs, and their tortures remedileſs; he makes <hi>Abraham</hi> return an anſwer to this wretched Son. <hi>My Son, remember, that thou in thy life time receivedſt thy good things, and likewiſe</hi> Lazarus <hi>evil things, but now he is comforted, and thou art tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Heathens have look'd upon Death, as the end of all their Afflictions and Sufferings, but they have never taſted of the Powers of the life to come, they have never had any aſſurance of future Glory and Happineſs. The Spiritual Joys, and Celeſtial Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, God keeps for them that fear him, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip him in Spirit and in Truth. Theſe precious Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and Divine Excellencies, are only diſcoverable to the faithful, eſpecially, ſince the time, in which Chriſt our Saviour hath put Life and Immortality to light, through the Gospel. Hitherto I have given you a ſhort ſurvey of the calamities that attend upon us in this mortal life; I have eſſayed to preſent unto you all the Comforts that we may gather from thence, to ſtrengthen a believing Soul, and enable it to withſtand and endure all the encounters with which it is aſſault<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:41646:204" rendition="simple:additions"/>in this Valley of Tears. At preſent I intend to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe its future Happineſs, when it is ſeparated from the Body, and introduc'd into Heaven; I ſhall, as far as I am able, diſcover unto you that Glory, and Bliſs which our Souls enjoy, in expectation of the great Morn of the Reſurrection. You muſt not think to ſee here any perfect Image of our Celeſtial Paradiſe, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny magnificent draught of the advantages reſerved for us there; it would be as difficult a taske as to paint the Sun in its ſplendor, or to meaſure the Waters of the Sea. I cannot find words to expreſs my thoughts, all my conceptions are far below that perfect Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and higheſt Glory; I ſhall think that I have done enough, if I can but repreſent unto you ſome few beams of ſo great a Light; If I can but ſhew ſome drops of that Ocean of Heavenly pleaſures, in which we ſhall ſwim for all Eternity.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not deliver any thing from my own fancy, nor offer to ſpeak of that which I have never learned from the great Doctor of our Souls; I ſhall not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage my ſelf in vain ſpeculations, more fit to pleaſe and puff up the curious Wits, then to comfort and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce the devout Souls, and ſatisfy ſuch as hunger and thirſt after Righteouſneſs: one word from the mouth of the Lord is better, and far more worth, than all the reaſonings of Humane Wiſdom, than all the ſubtilties of Philoſophy, than all the arguings and concluſions of the moſt refined and eloquent Ages. In this deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on I ſhall not ſeek mine own Glory, nor the applauſes of the World, but the Glory of my God, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the Souls which he hath purchaſed with his Bloud; I deſire to be underſtood of the weakeſt capacities, as well as of the ſtrongeſt; I hope that ſuch as know the language of <hi>Canaan,</hi> ſuch as have taſted of the good word of God, and of the powers of the Life to come, will not miſtake me; for ſuch as have
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:41646:205" rendition="simple:additions"/>not been accuſtomed in the diſcernment of ſpiritual things, unto whom the language of God's Holy Spirit is inſipid and unſufferable, if they are not moved, nor benefited by this Treatiſe, I dare ſay, 'tis none of my fault; but theirs. Therefore as the wiſe Men when they travell'd to <hi>Bethlem,</hi> where Jeſus Chriſt was lying in a Manger, took the Star of the <hi>Eaſt</hi> for their guide; Likewiſe, we that be marching to our true <hi>Bethlem,</hi> where our great God and Saviour is ſitting upon the Throne of his Glory; we will follow no other guid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, but that Divine Light which comes down from Heaven. And as it is impoſſible to number all the Stars that ſhine in the Heavens, therefore we are wont to reduce them to certain Figures and Conſtellations. Thus we will not undertake to ſhew you every parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular of our private Meditations, upon this Rich and Divine Subject; but we will diſcourſe unto you of the chief Heads, leaving the reſt to your pious Thoughts, and the information of God's Holy Spirit.</p>
            <p>Whoſoever thou art that haſt embraced Chriſt, dead and crucified, by Faith and Repentance, and knoweſt thy ſelf united to him, and incorporated into his my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical Body; remember to praiſe this Merciful Lord, and rejoyce in his Salvation. Learn to admire the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>excellent Riches of the Treaſuries of his Grace, and ſeriouſly conſider how magnificent and liberal he is to thee; for he intends not only to deliver thee from all the ſufferings and calamities that afflict thee, but he will alſo raiſe thee up to the higheſt and moſt tranſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Felicity: He will not only draw thee out of the deep Abyſſe of Death, and eternal Damnation, but he will take thee up to the Enjoyment of the moſt bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Life, and an immortal Glory. He will not only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move thee from this wretched Wilderneſs, where thou art tormented with Hunger and Thirſt, and expos'd to the ſcorching heat of a burning Sun, to poiſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb facs="tcp:41646:205" rendition="simple:additions"/>bitings of the fiery Serpents, but he will introduce thee into his Celeſtial <hi>Canaan,</hi> where the Milk and Honey of the pureſt Joys, and moſt ſolid Comforts flow in abundance, and where thou ſhalt for ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe thy ſelf, under the refreſhing Shadows of the Tree of Life, which is in the midſt of the Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe of God. He will not only deliver thee from the captivity of this miſerable World, which is a true <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon,</hi> full of all manner of abominations, but he will lead thee in to his Holy <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and carry thee thither upon his Arms; not with an intent that thou ſhouldeſt build and repair it with coſt and labor, but that thou ſhouldeſt behold the Glorious and Magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Structures, reared up by himſelf alone from the creation of the World, and that thou mayeſt be Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally ſatisfied with his overflowing Plenty. He will not only pluck off from thee the filthy rags of Sin and Corruption, but he will cloath thee with a Garment of Light, of perfect Righteouſneſs and Holineſs. He will not only wipe away all Tears from thine Eyes, but he will put into thy Mouth Songs of Praiſe and Thanksgiving. He will not only break the Fetters from thy Feet, but he will place upon thy Head a Crown of pure Gold. He will not only draw thee out of a black and noiſom Dungeon, but he will place thee upon a Throne of Glory and Magnificence. He will not only extinguiſh all the carnal Luſts that War againſt thee, and put an end to all thy troubleſome diſputes; but he calls thee to the fruition of an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Peace, and Celeſtial Triumphs. In ſhort, God will not only ſeparate thee from the acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of ſinful and debauch'd Men, but he will cauſe thee to enter in amongſt the thouſands of Angels, and admit thee to the viſion of his Glorious Face.</p>
            <p>When a compounded thing comes to be diſſolved, every part returns to its, firſt Principle; Likewiſe,
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:41646:206" rendition="simple:additions"/>when Man dies, his Body returns to Duſt, from whence it is taken, and the Soul returns to God that gave it. As the Bird, when its Cage is broken, flies away into the Air to ſeek lits Liberty and Pleaſure. Thus when this Body is broken to pieces by Death, the Soul flies above the Heavens, where it meets with Reſt and Happineſs; or as it is when the Net is torn, the Fiſh falls into the Water, where it lives and enjoys all its Delights; Thus when Death comes to break the ſtrings of this wretched Body, the Soul enters into the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of Living Water, and into an Ocean of Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Delights. Finally, as the death of our Saviour Chriſt rent in pieces the Vail of the Earthly Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary, and diſcover'd all its wonderful Myſteries. Thus the death of a Believer rents the Vail of this crazy and ſinful Fleſh, and gives us a ſight of the rich Treaſuries, and magnificent Excellencies of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Sanctuary. You <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> whom God calls to his Glorious Reſt, who may expreſs the greatneſs of your future happineſs? It is not poſſible to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine it as it is. When your whole Lives ſhould have been nothing elſe but a continuation of Miſery, and a Chain of Calamities; you have now juſt cauſe to comfort your ſelves, and rejoyce in God with an unſpeakable joy; for when all things are reckon'd up, the ſufferings of this preſent time are not worthy to be compared with the Glory which ſhall be revealed in us. You can looſe nothing in this life but God will reſtore to you an hundred times more in his Kingdom; beſides, there is no compariſon between the advantages of the life to come, and of this mortal Eſtate and Being. Grieve not, <hi>Believing S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>uls,</hi> to forſake an Earth over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpread with darkneſs, full of Miſery, and all infected with Sin; ſeeing that thy God purpoſes to receive thee into new Heavens, all enlightened with a Divine Light, and enriched with endleſs Felicities, where
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:41646:206" rendition="simple:additions"/>Righteouſneſs and Holineſs ſit upon the Throne. Grieve not for the loſs of the moſt Pious and Regenerated Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; Seeing that thou art to be admitted into the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies of the Glorified Saints, and Bleſſed Martyrs, who have waſhed and whitened their Garments, in the Sacred Bloud of the Lamb; Seeing that thou art from henceforth to be reckoned in the number, and of the ſociety of the Angels of Light, and of the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Cherubims. Fret not to leave behind thee the Holy Congregations of the Militant Church, for thou art going apace to the Glorious Congregation of the Church triumphing, and in a few moments thou ſhalt find thy ſelf amongſt the thouſands of Angels and Saints, that worſhip God day and night, and adore him, who lives for ever and ever. If God hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed upon thee worldly Riches, leave them without Regret or diſpleaſure, for thou art going to poſſeſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtimable Treaſures, which ſhall never be taken from thee. If thou art advanced to great Employments and Honors, caſt off thy Purple and Scarlet willingly, and of thine own accord, for God will ſhortly cloath thee with an infinite Glory, that ſhall never change. When thou ſhouldeſt be raiſed up to the higheſt, and moſt ſplendid Dignities, when thou ſhouldeſt enjoy a great and flouriſhing Kingdom, come down from thy Throne with joy, and let fall thy Scepter and thy Crown; for God calls thee to ſit upon a Throne that can never be ſhaken, to an incorruptible Crown, and to endleſs Joys.</p>
            <p>Can there be any Town ſo Rich, ſo Great and No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a Seat, that thou mayeſt juſtly grieve to forſake it, at that time when God intends to make thee a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizen with the Glorified Saints of the <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> from above; where neither Crying nor Labor, neither Fear nor Grief, neither Poverty nor Want ſhall ever come near thee; where all the Inhabitants are Kings, and
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:41646:207" rendition="simple:additions"/>poſſeſs Riches without value? Is there any Dwelling ſo Beautiful and Magnificent, that ſhould cauſe thee to depart out of it with ſorrow? for God will lead thee into his own Palace, all built with fine Gold and precious Stones, where God himſelf is the Light, and the Lamb is the Sun. Art thou delighted in the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſome pleaſant Inheritance here on Earth? Then conſider, that all the Inheritances of the Earth, are nothing in compariſon of that uncorruptible Inherit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance which God keeps for thee in Heaven, and hath prepared ſince the Creation of the World. Haſt thou a pleaſant Garden, or a rich Field? But what are all the Gardens of the World, in reſpect of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Paradiſe, where the Tree of Life grows, that brings forth its Fruits every moneth of the year, and where the River of living Water, as tranſparent as Chryſtal, runs continually.</p>
            <p>What reaſon haſt thou, <hi>Chriſtian Soul,</hi> to grieve, when thou forſakeſt the pleaſures of the World, that thou enjoyeſt with the Children of the Earth, or the Delights of the Body, which are common to thee with the bruit Beaſts: Seeing that God will ſatisfy thee with his moſt precious Delights; for in the bleſſed Viſion of his Face, thou ſhalt meet with ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of joy? Haſt thou any friends on Earth? Let it not trouble thee to leave them; for inſtead of one friend here below, whom thou fancieſt to be real and ſincere, thou haſt thouſands in Heaven, who will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive thee into the Eternal Manſions, and embrace thee as their companion, and the partaker of the ſame Glory and Happineſs. Haſt thou any Parents or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations? I ſuppoſe that they are not burdenſome to thee, and that thou receiveſt much more Pleaſure and Aſſiſtance from them, than Grief and Ingratitude; yet thou haſt a ſpiritual Parentage in Heaven, and Eternal Relations. Thou haſt in the Manſion-Houſe of

            <p>Thou <hi>Husband,</hi> whom Death ſnatcheth away from thy beloved Wife, ſeriouſly conſider, that God will unite thee to himſelf, by an unſcparable Union, and that he purpoſeth to take up to him, ſome part of thy ſelf, that thy expectations, thy hopes, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections might be now in Heaven. And thou alſo, O Woman! whom Death plucks out of the embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of thy dear and loving Husband, remember that thou haſt a Husband alſo in Heaven, who hath eſpouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thee to himſelf for ever in Righteouſneſs, in Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and Compaſſion; a Husband always Living and Glorious; a Husband, who loves thee with an Eternal Love, that is ſtronger than Death; whoſe affections are enflamed for thee in ſuch a manner, that the Water of all the Seas and Rivers, are not able to extinguiſh; a Husband, who bears with all thine infirmities, and hath redeemed thee from all thy ſins; a Husband who hath not ſpared for thee his precious Bloud, that he might procure for thee the Glory and Happineſs of his Kingdom; who invites thee to his Heavenly Nuptials, having prepared and appointed for thee a Room in the Banqueting-Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, where thouſands of glorified Saints ſhall ſit, and where the meledious Tunes of Angels ſhall be heard; a Husband who calls to thee, reacheth out unto thee his Hand, and opens his Boſom to receive thee. If thou haſt found any ſatisfaction and pleaſure in the company of that Perſon whom God had given thee for an Aſſiſtant, and Mate; judge from thence, what An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical Delights thou ſhalt meet with, in the raviſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing embraces of thy Heavenly Spouſe. The moſt plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant Marriage days are gone as a ſhadow, but the day
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:41646:208" rendition="simple:additions"/>which ſhall bring thee to thy Celeſtial Bridegroom, ſhall never depart nor darken, ſo that the Heavenly Contentments ſhall abide and continue with thee for ever, without the leaſt diſtaſte.</p>
            <p>You beloved, and loving Children, who are yet in the boſom of a good Father, or of a tender-hearted Mother, ſuffer Death patiently to remove you far from them, and depart with joy to that good God, that will receive you as his Children; ſatisfy your Souls with the Milk of his moſt Bleſſed Conſolations, and will make you his Heirs, and Co-Heirs with his Son Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, Say to him as the Holy Prophet, <hi>When my Father and my Mother ſhould forſake me, yet the Lord will receive me,</hi> Iſai. 66. Rom. 8. Pſal. 27. And you Fathers and Mothers, that have a tender affection for your Children, if Death takes them out of your ſight, and deprives you of the comfort of their company, grieve not as thoſe who have no hope, for when they ſhould be never ſo accompliſh'd, when they ſhould have never given you but pleaſure and divertiſement. What are all theſe pitiful Delights that paſs away in a moment, and that change oft-times into bitterneſs and ſorrow, if compared with the Eternal Pleaſures which we ſhall enjoy, in the contemplation of God's Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Face, and in a familiar acquaintance with his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Wiſdom? You ſhall not return to them, but they ſhall in their time go to you, ſo that you ſhall ſhortly ſee one another, in the Dwelling of the Father of Spirits, <hi>Matth.</hi> 27. Death ſeparates you for a while. but the Author of your Life will bring you together for ever.</p>
            <p>Finally, of what age and condition ſoever you be, if you perceive the breath of your Life to ſtop, never grieve nor murmure at it; for if Death ſeparates you from your Selves, it brings you nearer to God, your chief Good, and inſtead of a wretched and periſhing
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:41646:208" rendition="simple:additions"/>life, it will promote you to the fruition of an Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and ever happy one.</p>
            <p>If we had lived in the days when our Saviour was on Earth, there is none of us but would have look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon it as a ſingular Happineſs and Honor, to have been admitted with <hi>Peter, James,</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> when they went up to Mount <hi>Tabor,</hi> to be Eye-witneſſes of our Saviour's transfiguration; A far greater Honor and Happineſs, Death is endeavouring to procure you; it will uſher you up to Mount <hi>Sion,</hi> it will tranſport you above all the Heavens, where you ſhall behold more excellent wonders than ever the Apoſtles beheld upon Mount <hi>Tabor;</hi> for you ſhall not only ſee this Glorious Saviour whiter than the Snow, and brighter than the Sun, but you your ſelves ſhall be transfigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with him, and cloathed with an exceeding great Glory. The Holy Apoſtles ſaw but two Prophets, but you ſhall ſee all the Prophets, all the Patriarchs, Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, Confeſſors, Martyrs, the Holy and Bleſſed Virgin, and generally all the Saints that Reign and Triumph in Heaven. The Apoſtles had a ſight of this Glory of our Saviour, as of a flaſh of Lightning, it continued with them but for a moment, for ſoon after they came down from the Holy Mountain, and were again in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of the ſame temptations as before, and beſieged by the ſame Calamities. It will be otherwiſe with thee, O Chriſtian Soul, thou art flying up to Heaven, from whence thou ſhalt never deſcend, till the great day of the Glorious Reſurrection of our Bodies; Thou ſhalt not be aſſaulted any more by any temptation<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> thou ſhalt have no more Enemies to overcome, nor Bitterneſs to digeſt. Thou art going to reap and enjoy the Bleſſed Fruits of thy Saviours Victories, and to be Eternally ſatisfied with the Celeſtial Pleaſures that are at the right hand of the God of Mercies.</p>

            <p>We eſteem <hi>St. John</hi> highly priviledged, becauſe the Lord gave him a ſight of his Glory, of the Riches, and Divine Excellencies of the <hi>New Jeruſalem;</hi> but how much greater is thy priviledge? for that which this Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Apoſtle beheld in a Viſion and a Dream, God will diſcover to thee in Truth and Reality. Let thine Heart liſten, and thou ſhalt hear the voice of thy Saviour, calling already to thee feom Heaven, as unto his Belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Diſciple, <hi>Come and ſee,</hi> Come my good and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Servant, come my Son, or my Daughter, and I will ſhew thee my Glorious and Magnificent City, I will ſhew thee the Palace of my Glory, and all the Splendor and State of my Kingdom; Come, and I will expoſe before thine eyes, all my Riches, Treaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and my moſt precious Crowns; Come, and I will cauſe the River of Living Water, which proceeds from my Throne, to run before thee, and the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Delights that proceed from my Face; I ſhall ſhew thee all theſe Heavenly Treaſures and Glory, all the Angelical ſatisfactions, not in the viſions of the night, in an extaſy, in an Holy raviſhment of the Mind, or in a Prophetical elevation of the Soul, but I will diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover them to thee in Reality and Truth, by the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of a purer and more Glorious Light, than that of the Sun. I ſhall not only cauſe thee to behold this Glory, theſe Treaſures and Delight, but I will cauſe thee to be partakar of them for ever; for as thou haſt pledged me in the Cup of my bitterneſs and ſorrows, as thou haſt continued with me in my afflictions, and haſt been faithful unto Death; I will give the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to thee, as the Father hath given it to me, I will give thee the Crown of Life, and will cauſe thee to ſwim in the vaſt Ocean of the Eternal Pleaſures; Thou ſhalt not only ſee all my Treaſures, all my Pomp and Glory; thou ſhalt not only behold the Rivers and the Seas of my moſt wonderful Delights, and ſhalt be
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:41646:209" rendition="simple:additions"/>a partaker of them, but thou ſhalt ſee me as I am in my Kingdom; I will pull off the Vail that covers me, and ſcatter the Clouds and Miſts that hide me, ſo that thou ſhalt look upon me without hindrance, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold me face to face; thou ſhalt be transformed into my Likeneſs, and be ſatisfied with my Reſemblance. You ſee therefore <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> that although Death ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to us grievous, and ill-favoured, we may apply to it what <hi>David</hi> ſaid of <hi>Ahimaz,</hi> that it is the Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of good news; Notwithſtanding its hideous Vail and Cloak of Darkneſs, we have juſt cauſe to liken it to the Chariot of Fire, that carried up the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Elijah</hi> into Heaven.</p>
            <p>From what we have ſaid, you may eaſily conclude with the wiſeſt of Kings, <hi>That the day of our death is better than the day of our birth;</hi> for our Birth brings us upon a wretched Earth, but death carries us into a Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe of Heavenly Delights. Our Birth expoſeth us to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Encounters, but Death lifts us up upon a Chariot of Triumph. Our Birth expreſſeth from us Crying and Tears, but Death makes us ſing for joy; our Birth brings us into the Light, but Death cauſeth us to ſhine as the Sun; our Birth makes us to live a ſenſual and animal Life, of a ſhort continuance, but Death introduceth us into a Spiritual and Angelical Life, that ſhall continue for ever. In ſhort, our Birth caſts us into the Arms of Death, but Death leads to the Well-ſpring of Life.</p>
            <p>Therefore the Apoſtle <hi>St. Paul</hi> confeſſeth, that <hi>Chriſt is gain to him both in life and death,</hi> Phil. 1. And for the ſame reaſon, the Primitive Chriſtians could not endure to ſee any perſon afflicting himſelf, for the deceaſe of Believers, becauſe that it was the day of their Deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, Reſt, Glory, and Happineſs; they did commonly forbid all manner of Mourning, for they judged that it is not proper that we ſhould cloath our ſelves with black, and ſadneſs, for their ſakes who are clothed in white and ſhining Garments of Light and Immortality.
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:41646:210" rendition="simple:additions"/>They look'd upon this Life as upon a continual Death, and upon Death, as upon the beginning of a real Life. Therefore they ſtiled the aniverſary day of the Martyrs death, <hi>The day of their Nativity.</hi> From hence proceed the uſual Songs of Praiſe, which they did commonly ſing, to perpetuate their Bleſſed Memories.</p>
            <p>I need not cauſe you to take notice, <hi>devout Souls!</hi> of the notable difference between the death of God's Children, and the death of the wicked, It is as great as between Heaven and Earth, between Paradiſe and Hell. <hi>Balaam</hi> had good cauſe to deſire the one, and fear the conſequence of the other; we have as much reaſon to cry out as he did, <hi>Let me dye the death of the Righteous and let my laſt end be like his,</hi> Numb. 23.</p>
            <p>You have heard how an Heathen Prince made this addreſs to his Soul, <hi>My little Soul, my little Darling, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteſs and Companion of my Body;</hi>

If your friends or rather your enemies in this occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, weep, and are grieved at your departure; if they labour by their Tears and Sighs, to move your Heart, and to perſwade you to remain yet here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, ſpeak to them, as <hi>St. Paul</hi> did to thoſe that wept about his neck, <hi>What mean ye to weep and to break my heart?</hi> Acts 21. <hi>St. Paul</hi> was then in his jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> where he was to be bound and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned, and to be carried to the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> where he was to dye upon a Scaffold by the ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Head from his Body; notwithſtanding <hi>St. Paul</hi>'s friends comforted themſelves with this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, <hi>The VVill of the Lord be done.</hi> And what mean ye my friends? will ye hinder me from going up to an Heavenly <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> at the Gates whereof I muſt caſt off all theſe Chains and Fetters of Morta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; I muſt leave my Sins and all my Sufferings and Grief. I ſhall enter into a new Glory, into the ever bleſſed company of Saints and Angels. If your love be ſincere and real, prefer my Felicity and Reſt, to the ſmall ſatisfaction that you find in my company here below; Conſider, that in the Houſe of my God and in the viſion of his Glorious Face, I ſhall find every moment more Joy and Pleaſure, than I ſhould have met with upon Earth, in thouſands of Ages. All the Pomp and Splendor of the World, all the Glory and State, its Riches and Treaſures, its Pleaſures and Delights, are as unconſiderable to thoſe that I am go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to enjoy in Heaven, as a few drops of Water to a boundleſs Sea, or as a flaſh of Lightening to the Noon-Sun. Muſt the blind Paſſion which you have for to ſee me continue with you, hinder me from ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the face of my God and Heavenly Father? Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe I were now ſhut up with you in ſome dark Dungeon, and bound with the ſame Chain; would
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:41646:211" rendition="simple:additions"/>you rather ſee me your companion, to continue in your miſery, and ſufferings, than to behold me at a diſtance at liberty, in the fruition of a perfect ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction. Tell me not, that we ſhall never ſee one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other any more; for can you be ſo great an Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever to doubt of God's Mercy, that intends to bring us together again in Heaven. Death ſeparates us for a moment, but the Prince of Life will unite us to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether for ever in his Fathers Houſe, whither he is gone to prepare a place for us. O Devout and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Soul! by ſuch Language as this thou ſhalt be able to mollify the hardeſt Hearts, and prepare them to behold thy Tranſlation into Heaven, as <hi>Eliſha</hi> was, when he ſaw his Maſters Rapture. If they feel any diſpleaſure and grief for thy ſeparation from them; they will have more joy and comfort to conſider with the Eyes of Faith, that extraordinary Glory and Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs into which God intends to receive thee, of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Goodneſs and Mercy.</p>
            <p>If it happens otherwiſe, and that thou art to deal with weak minds, whoſe Love is blind, and whoſe Paſſions are ſo unreaſonable, as to reſiſt God's appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and to hinder thy promotion to Happineſs; thou muſt overcome, by the ſtrength of God's Grace, and the aſſiſtance of his Holy Spirit, all the furious reluctances of Nature. Thou muſt imitate <hi>St. Peter</hi> when he ſaw our Saviour Chriſt in his transfiguration upon Mount <hi>Tabor;</hi> he forgot his Family, and all his dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Enjoyments in the World, therefore in that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of joy, he cried out, <hi>Lord it is good for us to be here.</hi> In the ſame Language muſt you ſpeak, <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Souls;</hi> I dare be bold to affirm, if your mind is raiſed up by Faith into Heaven, to behold Jeſus Chriſt ſhining in Light and Glory, and ſurrounded by all the Holy Angels, and Immortal Spirits. Aſſoon as you ſhall have but the leaſt reliſh of Paradiſe, you will be ſo raviſh'd with that extraordinary Happineſs, that

I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, we ſhall not ſay as <hi>St. Peter, Let us build Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacles;</hi> For we ſhall never be concerned as Soldiers, and Travellers, in Fights and Journeys; We ſhall not ſay, let us build an Houſe, that we may dwell with thee and thy bleſſed company; for I ſee, O God, with the eye of Faith, the Palace which thou haſt built from the foundation of the World, where thou haſt prepared a place for me. Lord open to me the Gates of this Glorious Palace, that I may enter in, and ſing forth thy Divine Praiſes.</p>

Shall <hi>Socrates,</hi> whoſe crazy Body was animated by a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Soul, and who had no manner of Antidotes againſt Death; drink up that poiſon that was mixed for him as a pleaſant cup of Drink? And thou Chriſtian, that art animated by the Spirit of the living God, that ſeals to thee, his great and moſt precious promiſes; Thou Chriſtian, that enjoyeſt the earneſt of that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance, prepared for thee in Heaven; ſhalt not thou be able to ſwallow down, with content, the cup, that death holds out to thee? Thou haſt a powerful, and an infallible Antidote againſt this poiſon, for after this bitter Cup, thou art going where thou ſhalt drink at leaſure, out of the Rivers of Eternal Pleaſures. Shall it be ſaid, that in the Jews Houſes, at the time of death, the ſound of Inſtruments of Muſick was heard, together with Crying and Lamentations, and at thy Dwelling, who haſt an intereſt in Chriſt crucified, and ſeeſt him Reigning and Triumphing in Heaven; there ſhall be nothing heard but weeping and ſighing, that praiſing God, and giving of Thanks, ſhall not be ſeen at ſuch a time?</p>
            <p>Finally, ſeeing ſo many perſons of all Ages, Sexes, and Conditions, have deſired Death, to be freed from all Earthly Evils and Calamities; haſt not thou good cauſe to wiſh for it heartily, when it ſhall pleaſe God that thou mayeſt enter in the fruition of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages and happineſs of the Heavenly Life? How excellent is thy loving kindneſs, O God, therefore, the Children of Men, or rather thy Children, the Brothers and Siſters of Jeſus Chriſt, thy Well-belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Son, put their truſt under the ſhadow of thy wings; They ſhall be fully ſatisfied with the fatneſs of thy Houſe, and thou ſhalt cauſe them to drink out of the Rivers of thy Pleaſures.</p>

               </hi> becauſe God appeared unto him in that ſurpriſing Viſion, mentioned in the 28 of <hi>Geneſis;</hi> But if thou art an Iſraelite without fraud, I eſteem thee to be in a more happy, and a more bleſſed eſtate, thou haſt a greater cauſe to break out into <hi>Iacobs</hi> Language; <hi>This is Gods houſe, and the Gate of Heaven. Jacob</hi> it is true ſaw the Heavens open, but he was not admitted into them at that time, but now God opens theſe Heavens to receive and lodge thee for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. The holy Angels of God went up and down the Ladder that reached up from the Earth to Heaven, but they left <hi>Jacob</hi> at the bottom of this Ladder; whereas the Angels that are about thee are come down to cauſe thee to aſcend up with them, or rather to carry thee up in their hands, and bring thee to Chriſt typified by this my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterious Ladder. <hi>Jacob</hi> ſaw God at the top of this Lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, but he was to go afterwards to <hi>padan Aram,</hi> he was to travel up and down, to ſuffer many inconveniences, the heat of the day, the froſt of the night, the diſpleaſure of his Father-in-Law, and his Treachery; he was forced to fly from the cruelty of his Brother <hi>Eſau,</hi> nay more then that he was forced to ſtruggle and wreſtle with God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. Whereas here is now the end of thy Pilgrimage, of all thy troubles, and encounters: Thou ſhalt never feel the burning and ſcorching heat of thy Afflictions. Thou ſhalt be no more tortured with the fears and Apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that now congele thy Blood: Thou ſhalt no more ſtand upon thy guard for fear of the deceits, and violent dealings of Men: Thou ſhalt wreſtle no more with God
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:41646:214" rendition="simple:additions"/>by Prayers and Supplications, and tears, for they ſhall be no more in uſe. God ſhall load thee with his moſt extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary bleſſings, and beſtow himſelf upon thee.</p>

(O Religious Soul) thou art enflamed with this Divine affection, God will ſhortly fulfil all thy mind; ſo that thou mayſt ſay to him as one of the Prophets, <hi>Thou ſhalt cauſe me to know the way of Life, Thy face is the fulneſs of Joy, and at thy right hand are pleaſures for evermore.</hi>

            <p>Religious Soul, caſt off this ſpotted garment of the fleſh, and ſo much the more chearfully, becauſe God holds out in his Hand a Garment of Light and Glory, which he will beſtow upon thee; for it ſhall happen to thee as to the Prophet <hi>Elias,</hi> who having let fall his Mantle, he found himſelf all encompaſſed about with Flames of fire, and an extraordinary light; for aſſoon as thou ſhalt put off this miſerable body, thou ſhalt be ſurrounded with Celeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al flames, in which thou ſhalt mount up to Heaven into the dwelling of immortality, where thou ſhalt be like God, who cloaths himſelf with light as with a Garment.

At preſent thou art cloathed with a body under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by ſickneſs and labor, thou beareſt about thee the relicks of the old man; but behold, God calls to thee from his Holy Sanctuary, Take away from him this old garment, pluck off all remains of this old cloathing, beſpotted with ſin, where the Devils Image is yet to be ſeen; and give him the Sacred ornaments of a Royal Prieſthood; cloath this Soul with a long garment whitned in the Blood of the Lamb, gird it about with the Ephod of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, put upon its head, an uncorruptible Crown, and in its hand a Golden Viol, that it may for ever offer up the Heavenly perfumes in the company of all the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied Saints.</p>

Chriſtian Soul, remember thy beginning and thine end, conſider what thou art, from whence thou proceedeſt, and whither thou goeſt: Thou art a living Image of thy Creator, and a beam of glory; thou art of a ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtial and immortal nature; God hath waſhed and clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed thee in the Blood of his Lamb, without ſpot and blem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh; and ſanctified thee by his holy Spirit; he hath brought thee to an eſtate convenient to enter into his holy City, and he is ready to admit thee to take the fruition of his glory; Thou haſt <hi>fought the good fight, finiſhed thy courſe and kept the faith,</hi> it is therefore high time that thou ſhould<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt receive the Crown of life; Thou haſt this precious Crown already in thine hands, Thou art at the Gates of Heaven, and at the entrance of Paradiſe.</p>

Thy People</hi> Iſrael <hi>removed their Camp at thy Command, in the ſame manner I am ready to remove out of this Earthly Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle at the firſt motion of thy Will. The Golden Cherubims were alwayes upon their feet, with their wings ſtretched out, and their faces towards the Mercy Seat; O that I likewiſe might look up to him who hath purchaſed for me the eternal Mercies of God; him, who is the Propitiation for my Sins; that I may be always ready to fly up to him: Lord</hi> Jeſus! <hi>ſeeing thou calleſt me to thy ſelf, ſtretch out thy hand unto me from above, and draw me out of this tempeſtuous Sea. When a poor blind man underſtood that thou calledſt him to reſtore his ſight, he left his Garment for haſte and ran to thee with joy, and ſhall not I quit this wretched body to go to thee my Lord and my God? ſeeing thou calleſt me out of the mid-night of this World to thy marvelous and glorious light; ſeeing that thou haſt a deſign, not onely to diſcover to me this ſurpriſing and refreſhing light that ſhines in Heaven, but thou wilt cauſe me to ſhine in thy Kingdom as the Stars and as the Sun. When the Prophet</hi> Elias <hi>let fall his Mantle he was immediately received into a Chariot of Fire, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried up into Heaven; alſo, I hope in thy tender love and favor that as ſoon as my Soul ſhall forſake this wretched Body, it ſhall be likewiſe received into a Celeſtial Charriot of Fire,
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:41646:217" rendition="simple:additions"/>that will carry it up to Heaven, thou wilt deal as gratiouſly with my Soul as with thine High-Prieſt</hi> Joſhua; <hi>thou wilt take away its Garments ſhattered and broken by ſickneſs and diſtempers, beſpotted and bedaubed with ſin, to adorn it with Robes of fine and bright linnen, and Crown it with glory: Therefore I am ſo far from being afflicted to ſee the earthly houſe of this Tabernacle demoliſhed, that I rejoyce in a certain aſſurance that I ſhall be admitted to my eternal Tabernacle of Heaven. O good God! thou ſeeſt upon me a contemptible body of duſt, that deſires nothing more then to return to duſt again; but, this Heavenly and immortal Soul of mine, that is come from above, that is thy breath, and a beam of thy glory; this Soul, I ſay, will return up to its ſource and origin, It ſighs for thee, O God! and deſires nothing but eternal happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.

Lord, I ſhould be worſe then an Infidel if I did doubt of my Salvation; if I were not aſſured to partake of thy glory; for, thou haſt promiſed to ſave all ſuch as perſevere to the end, and to give the Crown of life to all thoſe that are faithfull unto Death. Seeing therefore, that by the aſſiſtance of thine holy Spirit, thou haſt enabled me to continue in thine holy and Divine Covenant, to fight the good fight, to finiſh my courſe, and to keep the faith; thou wilt not refuſe me this great Salvation, this precious Crown: O merciful and bountiful Lord, thou haſt promiſed all ſuch as overcome to cauſe them to ſit upon thy Throne; now, by thy ſpecial grace and wonderfull power that appears, and is fulfilled in mine infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, I have overcome the World, ſin, the Devil and Hell at preſent; I beſeech thee give me a new ſupply of ſtrength to overcome Death alſo, that I may have no more Enemies to counter with, but that I may mount upon the magnificent Throne deſigned for me; let this Death be a paſſage that may bring me to life, immortality, eternal glory; and to the happineſs of thy Kingdom. Thou art my God and Father, that loveſt me with an unchangeable affection, reach thy hand to me thy childe, for I long for thee, and open for me the bowels of

               </p>
            </argument>
            <p>WHen God Created Angels he gave them a Spiritual nature, that had little or no rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with the Elements; I confeſs that ſome of theſe Heavenly Spirits have often appeared in humane bodies to the ancient Patriarchs; but, thoſe bodies were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary and ſubitaneous, formed by Almighty Gods Power, for ſuch occaſions; beſides, thoſe holy Spirits were not in thoſe bodies as the Soul is in ours, quickning and animating them in the ſame manner, but onely as the Pilot is in the Ship that he governs; therefore as ſoon as they had fulfilled the work about which they were em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed by God; they left thoſe bodies without prejudice to their beings, as the Pilot leaves and goes out of the Ship, when he hath brought it to the deſired Haven. All the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of theſe glorified Spirits conſiſts in this, that God hath confirmed them in his grace and love, and admitted them for ever to a continual contemplation of his glorious face. It is not ſo with our Souls, for although they be alſo ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual and of an Heavenly ſubſtance, God hath not created them to be alone and to ſubſiſt at a diſtance from all matter, but to live in the pleaſant company of thoſe Element<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ial man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. When he creates an humane Soul and pours it into an organized body, it is not that it ſhould be there as water in a Veſſel, or as a King in his Palace: it lives not thereas an aſſiſting form, or as an outward cauſe of the Bodies operations, but it is united to it by a very ſtrict union, and ſerves as an eſſential form; It is the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of our life, the internal cauſe of motion of Senſe, and
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:41646:219" rendition="simple:additions"/>of underſtanding: So that if we will ſpeak properly, Man cannot be ſaid to be altogether of a Spiritual nature, as the holy Angels, nor a ſingle body, as the Sun, and the Stars; but, he is made up of both: Therefore if our Souls wiſh to depart out of this Earthly Tabernacle, it is not out of any diſpleaſure againſt it, as it is in it ſelf, for none did ever hate his own body, every one ſeeks to nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh and cheriſh it: But, by accident, becauſe of the vanity and corruption unto which ſin hath enthralled it, we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire earneſtly to depart out of it, to a place where righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and true holineſs raign, that we might be with the Lord <hi>Jeſus,</hi> to behold him nearer. It is therefore an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted truth, That, unleſs the body partakes of the ſame happineſs and glory of the Soul, Man cannot be ſaid to be perfectly and entirely happy. I confeſs, it is no light oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of joy to us, to know, that when our Soul caſts off this earthly body, it enters into the eternal Dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings of Heaven, whether it goes to behold the face of the Father of lights; But, this holy Joy is diſturbed with ſad reflections, and this Heavenly ſweetneſs is ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly altered with the bitter conſiderations of this poor body caſt into the earth, and left to the mercy of the crawl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Worms; for, it is a moſt hatefull thing to behold our body rotting and turning to aſhes; that body that was our pavillion, our Palace; nay more then ſo, that was a half part of our ſelves: Therefore if we will render our Joy accompliſhed, and apply an effectual comfort to our Souls, we muſt nouriſh and entertain this pleaſant aſſurance, That the ruine of our bodies, which cauſeth us to lament ſo much, ſhall not be eternal; but, as our bodies fall down by Death, they ſhall riſe again one day at the general Reſurrection. This is one of the nobleſt and moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Myſteries of our <hi>Chriſtian Religion,</hi> and one of its moſt glorious advantages: The Wiſdom of the World, with all its reaſonings, and the heatheniſh Philoſophy, with its rareſt ſubtleties, could never attain to this wholeſome and comfortable Doctrine: Therefore, when St. <hi>Paul</hi>
               <pb n="445" facs="tcp:41646:219" rendition="simple:additions"/>Preached to the Council of <hi>Athens,</hi> he was heard with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration, until he had ſpoken to them of the Reſurrection; as ſoon as he began to mention that, they laughed at him.</p>
            <p>Therefore, while <hi>Humane Reaſon</hi> remains in its darkneſs and <hi>Natural ignorance,</hi> it cannot of it ſelf find out the glorious Myſtery; but, as ſoon as it is enlightned with this <hi>light</hi> from <hi>above,</hi> it diſcovers its moſt temarkable circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, and acknowledgeth the <hi>Juſtice</hi> and <hi>Neceſſity</hi> of the <hi>future Reſurrection</hi> of our Bodies.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Seeing that Rewards and Puniſhments ought to be proportionable and anſwerable to him who is to puniſh and reward, we muſt of neceſſity eſtabliſh the <hi>Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> of our Bodies; otherwiſe, the pains of the wicked cannot be moſt violent, nor the happineſs of the Godly can never be abſolute and perfect.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> As when a Traytor is executed, men are wont to faſten to the Scaffold, or to burn in the fire, the Inſtruments and Tools with which he had aſſaulted or of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended his Prince; in the ſame manner, the bodies of the prophane and impious varlets, of the Traytors againſt God's Divine Majeſty ought to be treated, they ought to be eternally puniſhed with their Soul in Hell fire; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they have been the unhappy inſtruments employed in affronting our Creator.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The body is not onely the inſtrument em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed by the wicked againſt God, but, encourageth them and hurries them on in ſin; for, its humors ſtir it up, inflame it, and carry it to evil Acts: For example, its ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guine conſtitution makes it luxurious, and inclinable to the filthy luſts of the fleſh; its choler carries it to violent and furious actions; its mellancholy prompts it to the moſt horrid and helliſh attempts: So, that if ſuch are to be puniſhed that cauſe us to perform ſuch grievous acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, it belongs to Gods juſtice to inflict upon the body, as well as upon the Soul, eternal puniſhments.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, <hi>To every thing ther eis a ſeaſon, and a time, to every purpoſe under the Heaven.</hi> Eccleſ. 3. As the body of the
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:41646:220" rendition="simple:additions"/>wicked and of the reprobate hath had its good things, and its ſatisfactions during this life, it muſt needs have alſo in another life its puniſhments, and its torments.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> But, not to forget the reaſons which have a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to the faithful, and which are the Pillars and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porters of our faith and hope; we may ſay, That <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> is no leſs able to ſave us then <hi>Adam</hi> was to damn us: Now <hi>Adam</hi> having loſt both Soul and body, we muſt conclude, that it belongs to <hi>Chriſt</hi> to ſave them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo; Therefore the body is to riſe again, that it may par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of that Salvation or Redemption procured unto us by this great Saviour.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly, As we have born the Image of the firſt man, who was of the duſt of the Earth, we muſt alſo bear the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of the ſecond man, who comes from Heaven,</hi> 1 Cor. 15 Now, we bear not this Image at preſent, in this life, we muſt therefore bear it in another.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Seventhly,</hi> God hath not made a Covenant with part of man, but with all man, compoſed of Soul and body: The body therefore muſt needs riſe again, that it might gather the eternal fruits of glory and happineſs, which are promiſed unto us by this Divine <hi>Covenant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eighthly,</hi> God is not onely ſtiled, <hi>The Father of Spirits, and the God of the Spirits of all fleſh;</hi> Heb. 12. <hi>But he declares himſelf to be the God of</hi> Abraham, <hi>and of his Poſterity, Numb.</hi> 16.27. He is not onely the God of the Soul; or, the God of the body alone; but he is the God of believing perſons, of both their Souls and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies: from hence it follows of neceſſity, That the bodies of ſuch as are deceaſed, are not utterly deſtroyed, for God will raiſe them up again. With this argument <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſtopt the mouths of the <hi>Saduces,</hi> who denyed the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection; <hi>Concerning the Reſurrection of the Dead</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>Have you not read what God himſelf ſpeaks to you? I am the God of</hi> Abraham, <hi>the God of</hi> Iſaac, <hi>and the God of</hi> Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob; <hi>God is not the God of the Dead, but of the living.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ninthly,</hi> God hath adopted us to himſelf by <hi>Jeſus
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:41646:220" rendition="simple:additions"/>Chriſt,</hi> according to the good pleaſure of his Will, to make us the heirs of his Kingdom, and coheirs of his Son. From this paſſage we may gather a certain aſſurance of the Reſurrection, for when this Father of Mercies ſhall ſee our bodies lying in the duſt, out of his tenderneſs and compaſſion, he will ſay there are the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of my Children, the members of mine onely Son; it is not convenient to leave them alwayes in that ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full eſtate, in the bowels of the Earth; that love that I bear to them cannot ſuffer it; doubtleſs it was this conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration that cauſed the Apoſtle to call the redemption of our bodies <hi>Adoption,</hi> for by that he aſſures us that he ſhall fetch out of their graves the bodies of all them whom he hath Adopted; and that our future Reſurrection is an effect, and a neceſſary conſequence of our Adoption.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tenthly,</hi> If we conſider Death in it ſelf, as it is in its own nature, we ſhall find it to be the wages of ſin, and a puniſhment of our crimes: Now <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> hath paid for us theſe wages and ſatisfied for all our ſins, aboliſhing them in his Croſs, we may therefore conclude that Death <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> to be deſtroyed in reſpect of believers, and that their bodies muſt needs riſe again.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eleventhly,</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> aſſures us that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt is the Saviour of his body:</hi> Now the body of this great God and Redeemer conſiſts not onely in that infinite number of Souls, purchaſed with his Blood, but alſo in the Union of all the bodies that have been the companions of theſe bleſſed Souls: Therefore as he hath ſaved our Souls from Spiritual Death, and eternal damnation, he muſt alſo ſave our bodies from corporal death, and redeem them from the power of the grave.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Twelfthly,</hi> If death did for ever detain our bodies in the grave, we could not ſay, to ſpeak properly, that our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour hath ſwallowed up death into victory, and that he hath deſtroyed the Sepulcher, for in ſuch a caſe, Death and the Grave would remain victorious, and triumph eternally over theſe miſerable Bodies.</p>
            <pb n="448" facs="tcp:41646:221" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirteenth,</hi> Our Saviour hath ſuffered in his Soul and in his Body, and by that means he hath purchaſed to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf both our Souls and Bodies, according to St. <hi>Pauls</hi> excellent intimation; <hi>You are bought with a price, glorify therefore God, in your Bodies, and in your Souls, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long unto God.</hi> From hence we muſt conclude, that this glorious Saviour will be deprived of part of that which he hath purchaſed by his ineſtimable ſufferings, if our Bodies did alwayes continue in the power of Death.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourteenth,</hi> The holy Ghoſt hath Sanctified our Bodies and made them his Temples, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> teacheth us, <hi>Know ye not that you are the Temple of God, and that the holy Ghoſt dwelleth in you?</hi> From hence the Reſurrection of our bodies muſt needs follow as a neceſſary conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, for can we imagine that God will ſuffer the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of his Holineſs to continue for ever in its ruines and Deſolation; will he not rear up again the noble Pavilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his glory caſt down by Death?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifteenth,</hi> God hath predeſtinated us to make us confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable to the Image of his Son, that he might be the firſt-born amongſt many Brethren: Now the Soul and the Body of this onely begotten of the Father that were ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated by Death, have been joyned again in his glorious Reſurrection, and received into Heaven; therefore our Soul that departs out of the World to enter into Paradiſe, muſt return again to its Body, that we may aſcend up to Heaven both in Soul and Body. All the difference that appears between <hi>Chriſt</hi> and us is, that the precious Body of our noble Chieftain could not be ſubject to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, but was raiſed again as ſoon as it fell, becauſe of that ſtrict and perſonal Union between his Humanity and Divinity; whereas the moſt part of all other bodies are corrupt, and reduced to Aſhes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixteenth,</hi> We have the ſame holy Spirit, and Divine vertue dwelling in us, which was in our Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> the efficient cauſe of his Reſurrection, although not in the ſame meaſure and degree; therefore it will produce
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:41646:221" rendition="simple:additions"/>in us the ſame effect, and raiſe our bodies alſo from the duſt: St. <hi>Paul</hi> makes uſe of this Reaſon in the 8 of the <hi>Romans,</hi> if the <hi>Spirit of him that raiſed up</hi> Jeſus <hi>from the dead, dwelleth in you, he that raiſed up Chriſt from the dead ſhall alſo quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth in you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Seventeenth,</hi> The dead body that touched the bones of the Prophet <hi>Eliſha</hi> revived again on a ſudden: We have more cauſe to expect the Reſurrection of our bodies, becauſe our bodies don't onely touch <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> dead and riſen again, but we are become one body with him, fleſh of his fleſh, and bone of his bone: I am (ſaid he) <hi>the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection and the life, he that liveth and believeth in me ſhall never die; and he that believeth in me, though he were dead yet ſhall he live,</hi> Eph. 5. John 11.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eighteenth,</hi> God hath imprinted upon our bodies his own Signet, and the marks of his love; he hath given to them viſible and palpable aſſurances of their future bleſſedneſs. Under the <hi>Old Teſtament</hi> believers carried the <hi>Seal</hi> of the <hi>Covenant</hi> of God in their fleſh: for Circumciſion was the Seal of the righteouſneſs obtained by Faith and hope of a bleſſed immortality; they did alſo eat the fleſh of the Paſchal Lamb, which was a type of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> the true Lamb of God, that taketh away the ſins of the World. Likewiſe, under the <hi>New Covenant,</hi> God conſecrates to himſelf our Bodies by the <hi>Waters of Baptiſme,</hi> and by the <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine</hi> of the <hi>Lords Supper:</hi> So, by this means he aſſures them of a Joyfull and glorious Reſurrection. For, if by eating of this Bread, and drinking of this Wine, we eat and drink ſpiritually the fleſh and the Blood of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt,</hi> it is an infallible aſſurance that this Divine Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour will raiſe us up again at the end of the World; as he himſelf promiſeth, <hi>Whoſo eateth my fleſh and drinketh my Blood, hath eternal life, and I will raiſe him up at the laſt day,</hi> St John 6 54.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Nineteenth,</hi> The body of believers endures many aſſaults and evils for <hi>Chriſts</hi> ſake, and for his holy profeſſion,
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:41646:222" rendition="simple:additions"/>it is often expoſed to the moſt ſhamefull and moſt cruel torments; and partakes on the ſame ſufferings as he did on Earth; therefore it is juſt that it ſhould partake in his triumphs, glory, and eternal happineſs: <hi>It is a faithful ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, for if we be dead with him, we ſhall alſo live with him; if we ſuffer, we ſhall alſo raign with him. We always bear about in our bodies the dying of the Lord</hi> Jeſus, <hi>that the life alſo of</hi> Jeſus <hi>might be made manifeſt in our mortal fleſh,</hi> 2 Tim. 2. 2 Cor 4.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Twenty,</hi> There is nothing that God doth in vain, he never beſtowes upon us uſeleſs deſires; therefore, to what purpoſe hath he kindled in us ſuch an earneſt deſire to ſee this wretched Body out of the miſery and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion into which ſin hath enthralled it, and the fruition of glory and immortality? As St. <hi>Paul</hi> tels us in theſe words. <hi>The creature was made ſubject to vanity, not willingly, but by reaſon of him who hath ſubjected the ſame in hope, becauſe the creature it ſelf alſo ſhall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the Children of God: He adds immediately after, For, we know that the whole creation groaneth and travelleth in pain together until now, and not onely they but our ſelves alſo, which have the firſt fruits of the Spirit; even we our ſelves groane within our ſelves wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the Adoption, to wit the Redemption of our Body.</hi> Rom. 8.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Finally,</hi> Seeing, that whatſoever God hath appointed in his eternal Councel muſt be fulfilled in time, and that all things in the World attain to thoſe ends, for which he made them, and ſeeing that he created our Souls not to be alone, but to live in the company and fellowſhip with the Body, therefore this Body which falls down by Death muſt needs riſe again at the Reſurrection, that the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal Soul might return to and dwell with it for ever.</p>
            <p>To ſay that the Reſurrection of our bodies is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, is the greateſt and moſt abominable Atheiſm in the World: 'Tis to deny with impudency the infinite pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:41646:222" rendition="simple:additions"/>of God, and the ſacred Hiſtory of the Worlds Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: For if things are in their beings, as they are in workings, and if their operations are correſpondent to their natures, we muſt of neceſſity conclude, That if there be a God of an infinite being, he muſt needs have a power anſwerable to his being; And, by conſequence that this Almighty God, may, without difficulty raiſe the dead. If thou believeſt that God calls the things that are not as if they were; Wherefore doſt thou not alſo believe that this ſame God will alſo call the things that have been already to reſtore them that being which they have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly enjoyed from his Almighty Hand? If thou believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt that God hath faſhioned <hi>Eve</hi> out of one of her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands ribs, that he made Man of the duſt, and created this duſt out of nothing, canſt thou not alſo believe that God is able at the day of the Reſurrection to make again thy body of that duſt into which it is reduced, by Death? If thou believeſt that God hath breathed into <hi>Adams</hi> Noſtrils the breath of Life, that he hath created thy Soul, and infuſed it into thy Body, where it was never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; How canſt thou queſtion his power, of returning one day the ſame Soul into the ſame Body, where it for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly made its abode? In ſhort, if thou believeſt that the holy Ghoſt by moving upon the Waters, hath cauſed ſo many beautiful and noble Creatures to appear, and that he hath made light to ſhine out of darkneſs, canſt thou not be alſo perſwaded, that this ſame holy Ghoſt can ſhew his Power amongſt the Graves, and fetch thy Body out of the dark ſhadows of Death, to introduce it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="452" facs="tcp:41646:223" rendition="simple:additions"/>to Aſhes, and ſhall not God be able to reſtore man created after his own Image, and likeneſs, to his primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive eſtate and being? In a word, let the difficulties ſeem never ſo great, remember (Chriſtian Soul) what the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel <hi>Gabriel</hi> told the bleſſed Virgin, <hi>With God nothing ſhall be unpoſſible.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I know very well that it is an old Axiome of Philoſophy, <hi>From privation to the habit there is no returning.</hi> That is to ſay, when once we are deprived of, and have loſt, a natural faculty, it is never to be recovered again. But the prophane Atheiſts do wrongfully abuſe this Maxime, againſt the Article of our Reſurrection, for it is moſt true, in reſpect of natural and ſecondary cauſes: It is not to be doubted that when the faculties of nature are once loſt, they are not to be reſtored by Humane Art or Skill; and when a man is dead, 'tis not poſſible for all the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to bring him to life again: But nothing is able to limit the power of an infinite Agent. He that hath form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the wonderful eye in whom we live, move and have our being, cannot he open the Eyes of a Man born Blind and reſtore Life to a dead Corps? This ſame Philoſophy whereof the Maximes are brought againſt the Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction declares openly, <hi>That God can do all things, that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply not contradiction.</hi> Now there is no contradiction in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving that God can render life to him that had loſt it; and that what is fallen down by Death, ſhould riſe again by the Reſurrection. To the end that this Reſurrection of our Bodies might ſeem leſs ſtrange, God hath been pleaſed to give us in nature many Images, and likeneſſes. I am perſwaded <hi>(Believing Souls)</hi> that you will not be diſpleaſed if I mention here ſome of the chief.</p>
            <p>As when the Sun goeth down, and the Earth is cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the dark ſhadowes of the night, Mans declining and the darkneſs of the Grave is repreſented; likewiſe, when this King of the Stars riſes, when he brings with him the day over our Heads; there is a beautiful and perfect Image of the Reſurrection.</p>
            <pb n="453" facs="tcp:41646:223" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> When the Moon parts with all its light and Splendor, which it borrowes from the Sun, when it co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers it ſelf with a Vaile of darkneſs, 'tis the Image of Death, and a repreſentation of that Vaile which it draws over our eyes: but when the Sun begins to look upon it again, and by that means it recovers its former brightneſs and Glory, it diſcovers before our Eyes in a manner that which ſhall happen to our Bodies, when the Sun of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs ſhall riſe and caſt upon them his favourable aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Spring, Summer and Autumn, follow one after another, and the Winter ſhews us an Image of Death: but when the Sun begins to return again upon our heads, when it covers the Earth with a beautiful green, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vives the ſleeping vertues of Nature, he expreſſeth to us the Reſurrection in lively colors.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The Trees that are in Winter without Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, Fruits or Leaves, diſcover to us the hideous aſpect of Death, that ſtrips mans body, and deprives him of all that is beautiful and pleaſant to the eye; but, when theſe ſame Trees flouriſh again, and are loaden with freſh leaves and fruits, they put us in mind of the bleſſed Reſurrection of our Bodies.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> The ſeeds that corrupt and rot in the ground, repreſent our Bodies rotten in their Graves; but when theſe ſeeds appear above Ground, and flouriſh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs excellently well the bleſſed eſtate of our Bodies, ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing again to a new life, and recovering a perfect beauty, and a new glory. This ſimilitude the Son of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf recommends to us: <hi>If the grain of Wheat which falls to the Earth, doth not die it remains alone; but if it dies, it brings forth much fruit,</hi> John 22. And the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle St. <hi>Paul</hi> inſiſts at large upon this compariſon, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he exclaimes againſt the ſtupid Atheiſts who will not believe that a dead Body can revive again. <hi>O fool! that which thou ſoweſt is not quickned except it die,</hi> 2 Cor. 15.</p>
            <pb n="454" facs="tcp:41646:224" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> I find more wonderfull what is ſaid of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain herbs which riſe again out of their Aſhes; for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, if you burn <hi>Gall. Armois</hi> and fling its Aſhes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Earth, you ſhall ſee the ſame herb grow again: Many have tryed and found this by experience. The ſame is reported of a kind of Palm-tree, and becauſe in the <hi>Greek</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a Palm, is called <hi>Phaenix;</hi> this experiment hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven occaſion to the Fable of the <hi>Phaenix,</hi> a Bird that is ſaid to revive again out of its own marrow and Aſhes. Who is it but will ſay, that this is an excellent expreſſion of the Reſurrection of our Bodies?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Seventhly,</hi> There are alſo ſeveral ſorts of Inſects which ſhadow out unto us Death and the Reſurrection: As the ſilk Worms; for, when theſe ſmall creatures have finiſhed their work, and ſpun out that ſilk with which the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and ſtately attire of Kings and Princes are made, they bury themſelves in the Tomb which they build; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, they become like to a little Beane which hides under its thin skin the formation of a white Butter-fly. The ſame is obſerved of the Chenilles, Caterpillars, for when they ſeem ſtark dead, they creep out of their little Sepulchers in the forms of Butter-flies, of ſo many rare and various colors, that they raviſh the Eye into admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; ſo that many curious perſons keep them in their Cloſſets amongſt their rarities.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eightly,</hi> Amongſt the Beaſts alſo, ſome ſeem to be dead for ſeveral Months of the year, being without Senſe or Motion, but afterwards they awake again or rather they begin a new life to move about as they did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ninthly,</hi> But we need go no further then our ſelves to find the Image of Death, and of the Reſurrection; for, Is there any thing that can expreſs Death more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly then our dead ſleep, that Stupifies our Senſes, puts a ſtop to the Spirits of our Bodies, and binds up our moſt active faculties? So that we have then Eyes without feeing, ears without hearing, a noſe and cannot ſmell,
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:41646:224" rendition="simple:additions"/>and a living Body but we have no feeling: But as ſoon as ſuch a perſon comes to awake again, to open its eyes, to ſtir, and to act, he repreſents a moſt perfect Image of the Reſurrection.</p>
            <p>I might alſo add amongſt the Images of Death and the Reſurrection, the ſeveral changes and alterations that happen to the <hi>States</hi> and <hi>Empires</hi> of the World; for oftimes they appear as dead and buried, but afterwards they riſe again from their falls, and march out of their obſcurity as in a glorious Reſurrection: But, I ſhall wave theſe ſimilitudes, and conſider only ſuch as the <hi>Church</hi> of God in ſeveral Ages have recommended to us as Types of the future Reſurrection of our Bodies.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt, Noah</hi> and his Family, (in which, all the <hi>Church</hi> of God of that time was comprehended) remained in the Ark as in a floating Coffin, during the ſpace of one hundred and fifty dayes; But, after the deluge, God cauſed them to march out of that Ark: In the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, after that our Bodies ſhall have been in their Graves ſo many years or ages (as God hath appointed in his wonderful Wiſdom) he will draw them out again by his infinite power, and will ſay to us all. <hi>Come out and appear to Judgment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> went down into <hi>Egypt</hi> and dwelt there 200 years, or thereabouts, as in a kind of Sepulcher, but God delivered them and at laſt cauſed them to go up to the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> as by a bleſſed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The <hi>Red Sea,</hi> into which this People went down, and in which <hi>Pharao</hi> with all his hoſt was drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, is an Image of our Grave, and the great power which God diſcovered to make this people paſs through that dreadful Sea, and to go up out of its depths, as by a miracle, ſhews to the blindeſt underſtandings that Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty Power which God will one day declare in drawing his people out of the depths of Death, that we may be able to ſing the Song of <hi>Moſes</hi> and of the <hi>Lamb.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="456" facs="tcp:41646:225" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> When the <hi>Ark</hi> of <hi>Gods Covenant</hi> was taken Captive by the <hi>Philiſtins,</hi> and ſhut up in the houſe of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon,</hi> it was a Type of thoſe Bodies which God hath cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen for his <hi>Ark,</hi> and which are to remain for a time in Satans Priſons, under the Command of Death; but when the <hi>Philiſtins</hi> ſent back again this Ark, and that the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Iſrael</hi> received it with outward expreſſions of great Joy, it is a plain deſcription of that which ſhall happen, when God ſhall oblige Death to open all its Priſons, and releaſe all its priſoners; a deſcription I ſay of the wonderful Joy of the inhabitants of the <hi>Celeſtial Canaan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly, Babylon</hi> alſo, where the <hi>Church of Iſrael</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained Captive threeſcore and ten years, is a Symbolical repreſentation of the Grave; where theſe miſerable Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies are to continue in Captivity: Therefore, by alluſion, the Prophet ſtiles it a Lake without Water, but the deliverance of <hi>Iſrael</hi> from the <hi>Babyloniſh</hi> Captivity is a Type of our <hi>glorious Reſurrection:</hi> For that reaſon the holy Men of God declare it in ſuch termes as have reſpect to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of our Bodies from the Grave.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly, Solomons Temple,</hi> that was demoliſhed and pull'd down by <hi>Nebuchadnezar,</hi> and that lay many years in a deſolate condition, is another Type of the Body of believers deſtroyed by the Devil, and remaining for a time in the duſt: But, when the <hi>Jews</hi> were returned from <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon,</hi> they reared up the Walls of this Temple, and build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it again: This repreſents the Reſurrection of our Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, the Temples of the living God. Our Saviour had an eye to this alluſion, when he told the <hi>Jews, Deſtroy this Temple, and I will build it up again in three dayes;</hi> for, his beloved Diſciple adds immediately after, that he ſpoke of <hi>the Temple of his Body.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Seventhly,</hi> You may find the Types and Images of the ſame thing in many of the faithful, in <hi>Joſeph, Daniel</hi> and <hi>Jonns;</hi> for, as the Priſons of <hi>Egypt,</hi> the <hi>Lyon's-den</hi> and the Whales Belly, repreſent the Grave; likewiſe, when <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh</hi>
               <pb n="457" facs="tcp:41646:225" rendition="simple:additions"/>commands <hi>Joſeph</hi> out of Priſon, when <hi>Darius</hi> cauſeth <hi>Daniel</hi> to be taken out of the Den, and when God orders the Whale to return <hi>Jonas</hi> upon the dry ground, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection is thereby deſcribed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eightly,</hi> But, there is no paſſage, Type nor figure more expreſſible in the Old Teſtament, concerning the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, then that of the 37 of <hi>Ezekiel;</hi> for, that the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> might underſtand the greatneſs of Gods power, able to free them from the <hi>Babyloniſh</hi> Captivity, he cauſed the Reſurrection of the dead to appear before his Prophet; he carried him away into a large Field, covered all over with dead and dry Bones; but, at Gods command theſe Bones drew near one to another, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to be joined; afterwards the Sinews appeared, the fleſh covered them, and the skin was ſtretched over them; then a breath came from the four Winds upon theſe dead Bodies, entered into them, and they roſe up alive upon their feet, ſo that they ſeemed as a great Army.</p>
            <p>But, God hath not only repreſented the Reſurrection by many illuſtrious and excellent Types, but he hath alſo expreſly foretold it by the holy Prophets: <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſpeaks of this myſtery in an excellent manner, <hi>Thy dead Men ſhall live together, with my dead Body ſhall they riſe; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake and ſing ye that dwell in the duſt, for thy dew is as the dew of h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rbs, and the Earth ſhall caſt out the dead,</hi> Iſ. 26. And there can be nothing plainer than the Prophecy of the Prophet <hi>Daniel, And many of them that ſleep in the duſt of the Earth ſhall awake ſome to everlaſting life, and ſome to ſhame and everlaſting contempt, Dan</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>.2.</p>
            <p>Therefore, in hopes of the Reſurrection, the Patriarchs were very careful of their Tombs. <hi>Abraham</hi> the Father of the faithful, had no inheritance in the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and yet he was very deſirous to buy for himſelf and Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a burying place: When <hi>Jacob</hi> lay upon his Death Bed, he commanded his Son <hi>Joſeph</hi> in this manner; <hi>Deal kindly and truly with me, bury me not I pray thee in</hi> Egypt, <hi>but I will be with my Fathers, and thou ſhalt carry me out of</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:41646:226" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>and bury me in their burying place,</hi> Gen. 47. And, when <hi>Joſeph</hi> was ready to yield up his Soul unto God, he told his Brethren, <hi>That God would ſurely viſit them, and that they ſhould carry his Bones from thence,</hi> Gen. 50.</p>
            <p>All the faithful of the <hi>Old Teſtament</hi> have publickly decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red their expectation of this bleſſed Reſurrection from the dead; As may appear by that notable paſſage of <hi>Job. I know that my Redeemer liveth, and that he ſhall ſtand at the latter day upon the Earth; and though after my skin Worms deſtroy this Body, yet in my fleſh ſhall I ſee God, whom I ſhall ſee for my ſelf, and mine eyes ſhall behold and not another,</hi> Job 19. As may alſo appear by the magnificent words of <hi>David. I will behold thy Face in righteouſneſs, I ſhall be ſatiſfied when I wake with thy likeneſs,</hi> Pſ. 17.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Martha,</hi> the Siſter of <hi>Lazarus</hi> was well acquainted with this Myſtery, as is to be proved by what ſhe told our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour <hi>Chriſt; I know that my Brether ſhall riſe again at the Reſurrection at the laſt day:</hi> And, the <hi>Phariſes</hi> maintained the belief of the Reſurrection from the dead againſt the <hi>Saduces,</hi> who denied the Reſurrection, and immortality of the Soul: Therefore, when St. <hi>Paul</hi> was to anſwer for himſelf before the <hi>Iews</hi> Tribunal, where half were <hi>Phariſes,</hi> and half were <hi>Saduces,</hi> he made this crafty De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration; <hi>I am a</hi> Phariſe, <hi>and the Son of a</hi> Phariſe; <hi>for the hope of the Reſurrection of the dead I am called in queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:</hi> And when he made his Apology before <hi>Felix</hi> the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor, he ſpake in this manner; <hi>This I confeſs unto thee, that after the way which they call Hereſie, ſo worſhip I the God of my Fathers, believing all things which are written in the Law and the Prophets, and have hope towards God, which they themſelves alſo allow, that there ſhall be a Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the dead, both of the Juſt and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>njuſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As the <hi>Jews</hi> of our time have forſaken God, God hath alſo forſaken and given them over to a reprobate ſenſe, for, as they ſet aſide the infinite merits of the <hi>Death</hi> and <hi>Raſſion</hi> of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> they vainly perſwade themſelves, that their ſins are ſufficiently expiated by their own
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:41646:226" rendition="simple:additions"/>Deaths: Notwithſtanding the grievous corruptions that are to be found in their Doctrines, they depart out of this life in hopes of riſing again one day; for that reaſon they are careful in waſhing their dead Bodies, in burying them with honor and decency; and, when they have thus laid them in their Graves, they bow themſelves three times towards the Earth, and caſt behind them Graſs newly pluckt up from the Ground; by which ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony, they would have us underſtand, that the Corps which they lay in the Earth ſhall one day riſe again, and puſh forth, according to the Prophets expreſſion, <hi>Your Bones ſhall grow as the Graſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this Article of the Reſurrection of our Bodies, which is found in ſome few paſſages of the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is to be ſeen almoſt in every Page of the New; And, the paſſages concerning this truth are ſo plain and expreſs, that 'tis not poſſible to reject this wholeſome Doctrine; but we muſt at the ſame time abjure Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Religion, and give the lie to the holy Ghoſt.</p>
            <p>That our faith might be ſetled the better, God hath been pleaſed, not only to publiſh this Reſurrection from the dead by his Prophets and Apoſtles, he hath not only diſcovered to us many excellent and delightful Types and Figures of the Truth; but, to give to us a more experimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal teſtimony of his power, he hath raiſed ſeveral from the dead. In the Old Teſtament God raiſed up two Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, one at the Prayers of the Prophet <hi>Eliſha,</hi> the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at the requeſt of <hi>Eliſha</hi>'s Succeſſor, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 17. And, when a dead Body had been laid in <hi>Eliſha</hi>'s Grave, and touched his Bones, he returned to life again, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 6. And during our Saviours abode on Earth, he raiſed to life the Daughter of <hi>Jairus</hi> that was dead, the Widows Son of <hi>Nain,</hi> who was carried out of the Gate to be bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried; and <hi>Lazarus</hi> who had been four dayes lying in his Grave, whoſe body began to ſtink, <hi>Math.</hi> 9. <hi>Luke</hi> 7. When this merciful Saviour gave up the Ghoſt upon the Croſs, <hi>The Graves were opened, and many Bodies of Saints
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:41646:227" rendition="simple:additions"/>which ſlept aroſe, and came out of the Graves after his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, and went into the holy City and appeared unto ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, Math.</hi> 27. After his Aſcention he raiſed from the dead <hi>Dorcas</hi> a charitable Widow, at the Prayers of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and to comfort the poor Widows that wept for her; and a young man named <hi>Eutyches,</hi> was reſtored to life by the means of <hi>St. Paul;</hi> that the Congregation of believers, who were troubled at the unexpected fall, and ſudden Death of that man, might have cauſe to rejoyce, and comfort themſelves in an aſſurance upon God.</p>
            <p>But chiefly we have the example of our Lord, who hath raiſed himſelf up by his Divine Power: This glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious inſtance is able not only to ſtir up our admiration; but alſo to ſettle our Faith, and nouriſh our hopes: For, the Reſurrection of other perſons ſhew what God can do, but the Reſurrection of <hi>Chriſt</hi> declares unto us what God will do, and is an earneſt to aſſure us of our future Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection. It is not poſſible to believe as we ought, that <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> is riſen from the dead; but we muſt alſo, by a neceſſary conſequence, believe that he will raiſe us like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe: This St. <hi>Paul</hi> endeavours to teach us, <hi>If we believe that</hi> Jeſus Chriſt <hi>is dead and riſen, even ſo them alſo which ſleep in</hi> Jeſus <hi>will God bring with him.</hi> 1 Theſſ. 4. As the head is ſo ſhall the members be: As the firſt-fruits are, ſo ſhall the reſt of the harveſt be. The ſame Apoſtle labours to perſwade this truth in theſe excellent words; <hi>Chriſt is ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen from the dead, and become the firſt-fruits of them that ſlept; for ſince by man came Death, by man came alſo the Reſurrection of the dead; for as in</hi> Adam <hi>all die, ſo in</hi> Chriſt <hi>ſhall all be made alive: But every man in his own order,</hi> Chriſt <hi>the firſt-fruits, afterward they that are</hi> Chriſts <hi>at his coming.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some are ready to oppoſe againſt this holy and Divine Doctrine this objection; That ſome Bodies are conſumed by fire, and burn'd to aſhes; it is true: But, What follows from thence? For whether the Bodies be reduced to duſt or aſhes it matters not, God is able to reſtore them and
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:41646:227" rendition="simple:additions"/>render unto them their primitive forms: Seeing that cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain herbs (conſumed to aſhes) riſe again out of the ground, by a natural inclination, as we have already ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved; and, ſeeing that art is ſo induſtrious, as to make tranſparent Bodies (of an extraordinary beauty) of melt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed aſhes; ſhall not God, who is ſo far tranſcendent above all abilities of nature, created by him, and of all Arts and Sciences, which proceed from his direction, be able of aſhes, to compoſe a beautiful and a perfect body?</p>
            <p>Others pretend next, That a great many bodies have been drowned in the Seas, and ſwallowed up in the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; I acknowledge that to be true: But I affirm, that God is altogether as able to draw a body out of the depths of the Sea, as out of the bowels of the Earth. He that hath preſcribed bounds to this great Sea, that dries up its vaſt concavities, and layes open its bottomleſs bottom; Hath not he a command over this Sea? Cannot he oblige it to a reſtitution of thoſe bodies that have been committed to its keeping, as when he commanded the Whale to bring again to Land the Prophet <hi>Jonas,</hi> whom it had ſwallowed up alive?</p>
            <p>Some object, That there are bodies devoured by the Beaſts, which have been their Food, and have been turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into their ſubſtance: But, this objection is not to be valued; for, when an humane body ſhall have paſſed through the bowels of the Beaſts, and been changed a thouſand and a thouſand times into their ſubſtance, there is nothing that can hinder God from reſtoring them again at the day of the Reſurrection; for, thoſe Animals ſhall never riſe again: It is therefore nothing to the purpoſe to inquire after them, when the body ſhall reaſſume that which they ſhall have devoured, and turned into their own ſubſtances. The ſtrongeſt and moſt plauſible objection concerns <hi>the Anthropophages, the eaters of Men;</hi> for it is very well known, that in the <hi>Indies</hi> there are ſome Sava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges ſo barbarous as to feed upon humane fleſh, and to eſteem it as their greateſt dainties: Some anſwer to this,
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:41646:228" rendition="simple:additions"/>That ſuch kind of inhumanities are not ordinary, and that ſuch wretched <hi>Indians</hi> never practice ſuch hainous things but in urgent neceſſity, or when they purpoſe to revenge themſelves upon their Enemies: But, ſuch as have given an account of the <hi>New found America,</hi> relate, That in ſome Provinces there have been ſuch cruel and inhumane Savages, as not only to devour the fleſh of their Enemies whom they ſacrificed to their Idols, but alſo of their dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Friends, whom they do cut in pieces in their Shambles: Theſe ſame Hiſtorians tell us, That ſome of the barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous people are ſo impiouſly miſtaken, as to reckon it an act of piety and duty to their Parents and Friends, to give them a Sepulchre in their own ſtomachs. Moreover they ſay, That yet there are ſome, who, like ſo many mad Dogs feed upon Infants, and hunt after Men as we do after wild Beaſts of the Field. In caſe all theſe relations ſhould be true, I muſt deſire my Reader to take notice that are two kinds of parts that compoſe the humane body, the one ſolid, as the Bones and Nerves, and ſo eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential to it, that without them it would ceaſe from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any longer an humane body; the other parts are adventitious, accidental and changeable, they ſerve to maintain it almoſt as the food and nouriſhment: Now, this I affirm, as an undoubted Truth, that when it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens that Men feed upon their own Kind, God takes care, by his wonderful Providence, that the eſſential and ſolid parts of the Man devoured never enter into the ſubſtance or compoſition or the ſolid parts of the devourer. At the great day of the Reſurrection, the bodies will reaſſume all their eſſential and ſolid parts, without which they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be true bodies; but, they ſhall not need the acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal and fluid parts, as are the humors and the Blood, for then, they ſhall have no more inward heat to conſume them, no more hunger and thirſt; Therefore they ſhall never have any need of meat or of drink, or of any other thing whatſoever to ſerve them inſtead of Nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Let the mettals be never ſo much ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:41646:228" rendition="simple:additions"/>the Goldſmith ſeparates them with eaſe. Thus let our humane Bodies be never ſo much altered and ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, God will be able enough to ſeparate and diſtinguiſh them from one another: Shen the Goldſmith will ſeparate the mettals he caſts them into the melting-pot, and cauſeth them to paſs through the Fire; but God who can do all things without means, hath no need of the Fire or of the melt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-pot, for by his word at the twingling of an eye, he can cauſe this ſeparation to be made; and render unto every Body that which neceſſarily belongs to its compoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. In a word, when the difficulty ſhould be far greater than it is, and when the reſolution of this objection were not ſo eaſie to be made as it is; it ſhould not weaken our Faith, or cauſe us to doubt of the Reſurrection of our Bodies.</p>
            <p>When it concerns things that the holy Scripture doth not expreſly declare and decide, or that cannot be drawn from it by a neceſſary conſequence, it is lawful to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute either for, or againſt ſuch things; but if it concerns ſuch as this ſacred Writ, inſpired of God, plainly ſets forth, our Faith muſt learn her Duty, to ſubmit to Almighty God, and believe that there is nothing impoſſible with him. Now this Doctrine of the Reſurrection of the dead is ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſy and plainly found in this Holy Scripture, that it ſeems as viſible as the beams of the Noon-Sun. Many queſtions are made upon this ſubject, ſome are of that importance, that a reply will give moſt ſatisfaction upon this excellent ſubject; firſt, they inquire by whom and by whoſe Power ſhall the Reſurrection be effected? The Scripture gives an occaſion to make this inquiry, for it aſcribes it ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to the Father as in the 5 of St. <hi>John, The Father raiſes the dead and quickens them,</hi> ſometimes to the <hi>Son as in the</hi> 3 <hi>of the</hi> Phil. Jeſus Chriſt <hi>ſhall change our vile Bodies according to his mighty working, whereby he is able to ſubdue all things unto himſelf.</hi> And ſometimes to the Holy Ghoſt, as in 8 <hi>Rom. If the Spirit of him who hath raiſed</hi> Jeſus <hi>from the dead, dwelleth in you, he that hath raiſed up</hi> Jeſus
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:41646:229" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>from the dead ſhall quicken your mortal Bodies by his Holy Spirit that dwelleth in you.</hi> This difficulty may thus be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved; All the outward works of God, that concern the Creatures, are common to the three Perſons, of the moſt Holy, moſt Glorious, and moſt Wonderful Trinity.</p>
            <p>So that we ſhall riſe again by the the infinite Power of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs, the Reſurrection is eſpecialy aſcribed to the Son as he is Judge of the quick and of the dead: In or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the diſcharge of that glorious employment, all Power hath been committed to him in Heaven, and in Earth, and in the Seas.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Some inquire further, When ſhall this Reſurrection be? I anſwer, that it ſhall be in the day which God hath appointed, to Judge all the World, by the Man whom he hath ordained, <hi>Acts</hi> 17. You are not to expect from me, <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> that I ſhould point out unto you preciſely the day when this ſhall come to paſs, for it belongs not to us, to know the times, and the Seaſons which God hath reſerved to himſelf. It is true, we may ſee that moſt part of the Prophecies are already fulfilled, ſo that we may ſay in general terms, <hi>The Lord is at hand, and our Salvation is nearer to us then when we began to believe,</hi> Phil. 4 Rom. 13.</p>
            <p>Nevertheleſs, I cannot undertake to make out unto you this Glorious Day, nor to tell you the year, nor age, when this ſhall be; There is no Man upon Earth, nor Angel in Heaven that is able to ſpeak of it with certainty; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> himſelf informs us, <hi>But of that Day and Hour knoweth no Man, no not the Angels of Heaven, but my Father onely,</hi> Mat. 24. If our Saviour ſaith more, that <hi>the Son himſelf knoweth not the Day,</hi> Mark 13. We muſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand this as he is a Man, and during his abode in the World, for as he is God he knoweth all things, from all Eternity; and now that he is glorified as he is Man, he underſtands all things. But he hath hid from Men, the time of his coming, that we might expect him at every moment; as he tells the Holy Apoſtles, <hi>Watch therefore,

            <p>The Wiſeman tells us, that <hi>hope delayed cauſeth the heart to languiſh,</hi> Prov. 3. But we muſt except the hope and expectation of the Reſurrection, for when this bleſſed Reſurrection ſhould not come to paſs, yet many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Ages, it ſhould not cauſe ſuch as dy in the Lord to languiſh, for whiles their Bodies are in their Graves, they ſuffer nothing, and as they are there without feeling cannot be impatient, no more then a Man that is in a deep ſleep; for the Soul it enjoyes, in the contemplation of Gods Face, ſuch unſpeakable ſatisfactions, that it is not capable of grief, ſorrow, diſpleaſure, or the leaſt diſturbance. St. <hi>Peter</hi> tells us, <hi>that a thouſand years with God are but as a day,</hi> 2 Pet. 3. We may ſay the ſame of thoſe who are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to Gods glorious preſence, to behold his Face, for a thouſand years, in ſuch an happy Eſtate, appear leſs then
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:41646:230" rendition="simple:additions"/>one day in this miſerable condition. The hundreds and thouſands of years paſs away far quicker to the bleſſed Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of Heaven, then the moments do to ſuch as live in troubles upon Earth.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Others deſire to know where this Reſurrection ſhall happen? The <hi>Jewiſh</hi> whimſeys and extravagancies have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven occaſion to this queſtion, for they think that the dead ſhall riſe in no other place but in the Holy-Land; and therefore they have made another childiſh Fable, that the Bodies of all their Nation that die in ſeveral parts of the World, ſhall go through earthly vaults, and roule through the ſecret conveyances of this Globe, until they come to the Land of <hi>Canaan;</hi> where they are to ariſe from the dead; and as one error occaſions another, they ſay further, That they ſhall feel more or leſs pain in their paſſage, according to their goodneſs, or ſins of their lives. I need not ſpend any time in the refutation of this fooliſh and impertinent opinion; but it may juſtly cauſe us to acknowledge the juſt Judgment of God, upon this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy people, who have refuſed with a divelliſh obſtinacy the great Saviour of the World; for becauſe they have not received the love of the truth that they might be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, God hath ſent them ſtrong deluſions, that they might believe a lie, and hath given them over to a reprobate ſence, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2. For us, Chriſtians; we ſay that without ſo much ado where the body is, at the laſt day, there it ſhall riſe from its Grave.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The next queſtion is, What ſhall riſe from the dead? I anſwer, that the ſame body which falls by Death ſhall riſe again at the General Reſurrection; if God did make a new Body to joyn it to our Souls, it would be no more a Reſurrection, but rather a new Creation: neither ſhall we onely take ſuch a Body as our own, for things that are only like, are not the ſame; let them be never ſo much a like; but we ſhall take again the ſame Body, which our Soul doth animate, during its abode here below; and if I may employ the expreſſions and terms of Divines, it
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:41646:230" rendition="simple:additions"/>ſhall not only be the ſame Body, but alſo the ſame Indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual; as in the firſt Reſurrection, God creates not a new Soul, but he regenerates and ſanctifies that which was dead, in its treſpaſſes and ſins; thus in the ſecond Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectioin God makes not another Body, but he onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtows another life upon that which was lying in cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, and amongſt the dead. As when our Saviour roſe from the dead, he made not for himſelf a new Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, but he took again that ſame which had been formed in the Womb of the bleſſed Virgin. Likewiſe, in the General Reſurrection, he will not create for us a new Body, but he will render unto us that ſame which we had from our Mothers Womb; this argument is not to be anſwered, for the Reſurrection of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> is not onely the efficient or merritorious cauſe of ours, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the patern and model, or as the School-men tell us, it is the exemplary cauſe of our future Reſurrection, but there is no need of arguments, when the Word of God is ſo clear and expreſs on this ſubject. St. <hi>Paul</hi> informs us, <hi>That the Lord ſhall change our vile Body, that this corruptible muſt put on incorruption, this mortal muſt put on immortality, Phil.</hi> 3, <hi>And that the life of</hi> Jeſus <hi>ſhall be made manifeſt in our mortal fleſh,</hi> 2 Cor. 4. And the only <hi>Job</hi> ſaith, <hi>Job</hi> 19. not only <hi>that he ſhall ſee God, but that he ſhall ſee God in his fleſh, and that he ſhall ſee him with his Eyes:</hi> For the ſame reaſon in ſome ancient Copies of our Apoſtles Creed, as in the Creed of <hi>Aquilia,</hi> I find not only, <hi>I believe the Reſurrection of the fleſh, but I be ieve the Reſurrection of this fleſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. Some aske whether the Bodies of the wicked ſhall riſe from the dead, as well as the Bodies of the righteous? the Jews that delight in whimſycal inventions, fancy a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection only for the Juſt, in which unbelievers and reprobates have no ſhare. To ſtrengthen this dream they abuſe the words of the firſt <hi>Pſalm, The wicked ſhall not ſtand in judgment, nor ſinners in the Congregation of he righteous.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="468" facs="tcp:41646:231" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Finally.</hi> They are ſo much beſotted with an high con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of themſelves, that none are righteous but of their own Nation; That none are pleaſing to God, or that ought to riſe again from the dead but the Iſraelites; but, we Chriſtians, are brought up and inſtructed in better Doctrine, we believe, without difficulty, that all Men that are dead ſince the beginning of the World, of every People and Nation under Heaven, ſhall riſe again at the day of Judgment: for St. <hi>Paul</hi> aſſures us, <hi>That there ſhall be a Reſurection of the Juſt, and of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>njuſt. Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> in the firſt <hi>Pſalm</hi> ſpeaks nothing againſt this truth, which is clear as the Sun, and as well grounded as the Heavens, and the Earth, for he ſaith not that the wicked ſhall not riſe again, but only that he ſhall not ſtand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God in judgment; that is to ſay, that he ſhall not ſubſiſt before the Tribunal of Gods Juſtice, nor be able to abide the fiery preſence of God, angry and diſpleaſed for their impieties: But this we may obſerve, that although God will raiſe up all the Men of the World, without excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from their Graves, there ſhall be a notable diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between them; for he will raiſe the wicked up and draw them out of their Graves, as a Judge drags an Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender out of his Dungeon to ſentence him to Death; but he will raiſe again believers as their Redeemer, that their Bodies as well as their Souls might enjoy the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed fruits of their Redemption purchaſed for us: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this Divine Saviour ſtiles them <hi>Children of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection;</hi> for none but they ſhall inherit his bleſſings, and partake of his Eternal Glory.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Some inquire further, in what manner ſhall this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection be? I anſwer, That our Lord and Saviour ſhall come down from Heaven cloathed with light and glory, and attended upon by the Angels of his Power and millions of his Saints, He ſhall be preceded by the cry of an Arch-Angel, and the Trumpet of God: for the Trumpet ſhall ſound, and as at the ſounding of the Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Trumpet, that did Proclaim the <hi>Jews</hi> Jubile, all the
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:41646:231" rendition="simple:additions"/>Priſons were opened and the Priſoners ſet at liberty; in the ſame manner, at the ſound of the laſt Trumpet, all the Priſons of Death ſhall be broke open, and the Bodies that were impriſoned ſhall go out; to ſpeak in the Language of the Holy Ghoſt; <hi>The Sea ſhall give up the dead, and Death and Hell ſhall reſtore the dead that are in them.</hi> And as <hi>Lazarus</hi> roſe up as ſoon as <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> had called to him in his Tomb, Lazarus <hi>come out;</hi> likewiſe, when the Voice of this great God and Saviour ſhall ſound in our Tombs, at that moment we ſhall riſe again, and appear before him; for the hour cometh that ſuch as are in the Graves ſhall hear the Voice of the Son of God, and they that ſhall hear ſhall live.</p>
            <p n="7">7. The next queſtion is, in what ſtature of Body ſhall we riſe? ſome are perſwaded that we ſhall riſe in the ſame ſtature that we dy; this they gather from St. <hi>Iohn's</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of the laſt Judgment, <hi>I ſaw the living and the dead, the great and ſmall ſtanding before God.</hi> Others think that all the elect ſhall riſe again in perfect ſtature, and ſhall be all like to our Saviour <hi>Chriſt;</hi> which they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavor to prove, by St. <hi>Paul's</hi> words; <hi>We ſhall meet in a perfect Man, to the meaſure of the perfect ſtature of</hi> Chriſt.</p>
            <p>When it concerns things that relate to our Salvation, it is reſpective ignorance to refuſe, to pry into thoſe things which God hath concealed, or not thought fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to reveal; therefore as the holy Writ is ſilent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this, we cannot ſpeak of it with too much ſobri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety; I dare not affirm, that we ſhall all riſe again in the ſame ſtature. I confeſs, that this opinion, That all the Saints ſhall have a ſtature like to our Saviour <hi>Chriſt;</hi> and that they ſhall bear his Image and likeneſs, in that reſpect in their Bodies, contains nothing contrary to piety, but I dare ſay, that this cannot be proved by the words of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> for the ſequel of his diſcourſe ſhews moſt evidently that he intends not the ſtature of the Body, but that of the Soul, which conſiſts in knowledge and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
            <pb n="470" facs="tcp:41646:232" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p>That opinion which appears to be moſt likely, and moſt conformable to the Analogy of Faith, is, that the Elect ſhall all riſe again in a perfect ſtature; for the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and perfection of the ſtature contributes much to the Glory and Majeſty of the Body, without which man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſaid to be moſt perfectly happy: beſides this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection is anſwerable to that Command and Dominion which God ſhall give to the Saints, over the Creatures after the Reſurrection: if thoſe that die in their childhood, did riſe again in the ſame ſtature, if thoſe that depart in their old and decrepid Age, did come out of their Graves with their feeble and craſie Bodies, How could either of them be fit for that Glory and Perfection, where nothing ſhall be amiſs or wanting? As the promiſed Land was the Type of the Celeſtial <hi>Canaan,</hi> it is not without good cauſe that the Scripture takes notice that there was no Body of thoſe that went over <hi>Jordain</hi> into the Holy Land that was old and decrepid; unleſs it were <hi>Joſhua</hi> and <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leb;</hi> none of the reſt was threeſcore years old; I may alſo apply to the <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> above, that which the Prophet ſaith of the <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> here below, the Type and Figure of the Celeſtial: <hi>From thenceforth there ſhall not be any Child of a few days old, nor no ancient perſon who fulfilleth not his dayes.</hi> Finally, As God created <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> in a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect ſtature, to ſettle them in the Terreſtial Paradiſe, it is my opinion, that he will alſo raiſe up all the faithful in a perfect ſtature, to introduce them into the Celeſtial Paradiſe. In this life the Body of a Child is many years before it can to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to the ſtature of a perfect man: but at the great day of the Reſurrection God will grant it to him in a moment.</p>
            <p>That which is ſpoken of in the 20 of the <hi>Revelations</hi> doth in no wiſe oppoſe this Doctrine, for when the holy Ghoſt ſaith that <hi>the dead ſmall and great ſhall ſtand before God.</hi> That relates not to the ſtature or bigneſs of Body, but to the ſtate, and condition of the perſons; that is to ſay, the Kings and Princes ſhall appear to Judgment as well as the vileſt and moſt contemptible Subjects and the moſt wretched
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:41646:232" rendition="simple:additions"/>ſlaves; therefore theſe former words are deſigned to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs nothing more than what St. Paul ſaith, <hi>That we muſt all appear before the Judgement Seat of Chirſt, that we might receive in our Bodies according as we have done, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be good or evil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="8">8. Some are ready to ask what manner of Bodies ſhall the Reprobates have after the Reſurrection? I have no mind to ſpeak any thing of my ſelf, otherwiſe I ſhould anſwer, That in conſideration of the fury of Hell Fire, the ſmoak of the bottomleſs pit, and the violence of the exceſſive Torments which they ſhall ſuffer, they ſhall appear moſt deformed, ugly, il-favoured, and dreadful to look upon; I ſhould ſay, that there ſhall appear in their guilty looks, and frighted countenances, the Devils Image, and that of the Helliſh Furies; but it will be ſufficient to reply, That the Bodies of the wicked ſhall be Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, and that their Immortality ſhall be moſt miſerable; that it had been far better for them to have never been, or to have been as the Beaſts, that Die without any hopes of living again; for they ſhall Live to Die eternally, and they ſhall Die but never conſume away. It ſhall not be poſſible to add any thing to their moſt violent Tortures, for they ſhall be infinite; nor to the continuance of their ſufferings, for they ſhall be eternal; Therefore as we have already taken notice, they ſhall ſeek Death, that is, they ſhall deſire to be reduced to nothing, but Death ſhall flie away from them, and give them over to a Worm that ſhall never Dye, and to a Fire that ſhall never be extinguiſhed. O miſerable Bodies! O wretched Souls! whom God ſhall caſt into the midſt of Hells furious flames, and againſt whom the Devils ſhall let flie all their Arrows, diſcharge all their Fury, and kindle all their Fires, and whom they will take pleaſure to torment for ever and ever.</p>
            <p n="9">9. Some inquire what manner of Bodies the Children of God, and the Members of Chriſt ſhall have after they are riſen from the Dead, I anſwer, that their ſubſtance ſhall be the ſame which they had before Death; they ſhall not be
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:41646:233" rendition="simple:additions"/>Phantaſms or falſe appearances, but true humane Bodies, made up of fleſh and bones; for we may ſay of all the Bodies of the faithful, as of that of our Saviour Chriſt, that the Reſurrection will procure unto them a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Glory, which they never had before, but it ſhall not deſtroy their Nature and Manhood. They ſhall be able to ſpeak in the Language of our Redeemer, <hi>feel and ſee, a Spirit hath neither Fleſh nor Bones, as ye ſee that I have.</hi> All our Soul ſhall loſe nothing of its Being, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it ſhall be perfectly cleanſed from all Sin and Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſanctified in ſuch a manner, that it will not be poffible for it to entertain any vicious inclination; like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe there ſhall be no alteration in the eſſential part of our Bodies, but there ſhall be a wonderful alteration in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the qualities, for they ſhall caſt off all corruption and mortality, and ſhall never be ſubject to Sickneſs, Pain, nor to the inconveniences that diſturb it during this life. And if they have now any imperfection, they ſhall be perfectly freed; ſo that we may juſtly ſay of the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtial <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> that in it, no Blind nor Lame ſhall be admitted to enter, for all the Bodies of the Saints ſhall be ſo perfect and beautiful, that the leaſt ſpot or blemiſh ſhall not be ſeen in them, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6.</p>
            <p>I know that Jeſus Chriſt tells us in his Goſpel, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. <hi>If thy right Eye offend thee pluck it out, and caſt it from thee, for it is better that one of thy Members periſh, than that thy whole Body ſhould be caſt into Hell; and if thy hand or thy foot offend thee, cut it off and caſt it from thee, for it is better that thou ſhouldſt enter into life lame or maimed, than to have two feet and two hands, and to be caſt into eternal Fire, Mark</hi> 4. But theſe words are figurative; by them our Saviour would teach us, that for his ſake and glory we muſt deny our deareſt affections, and our moſt importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate luſts: and when theſe words ſhould be taken in their literal ſence, we muſt underſtand a Suppoſition if it were poſſible to enter into the Kingdom of Heaven with one eye, lame, maimed, it would be far better to be admitted to that
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:41646:233" rendition="simple:additions"/>bleſſed eſtate, then to have a perfect and a whole body, and to be caſt into the Torments of Hell. From thence we cannot conclude, that the faithful are to riſe from their Graves, with imperfect and deficient Bodies, for that is repugnant to an accompliſhed happineſs, ſeeing that ſin ſhall be utterly aboliſhed and deſtroyed, the puniſhment of Sin ſhall continue no longer.</p>
            <p>There are nevertheleſs ſome that believe with ſeveral ancient Doctors of the Primitive Church, that the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Martyrs ſhall bear about them the ſcars and other marks of their Sufferings, for the Name of Jeſus, in the ſame manner as this glorious Saviour after his Reſurrection could ſhew the print of the Nails, that had faſtened his feet and hands to the Croſs, and in his ſide the hole that the Spear had made. They eſteem ſuch Marks, glorious and honorable Stars, ſo that according to their judgement, the Martyrs ſhall be like to the generous and noble hearted Souldiers, who have received Wounds in the ſervice of their Prince, which they bear about as undoubted ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of their Courage. I ſhall not altogether con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict this opinion, for it is not contrary to the Analogy of Faith, but I dare not affirm it as a certain truth, for we cannot learn from the holy Scriptures, that repreſent theſe Bleſſed Martyrs, cloathed with long Robes, waſhed and whitened in the Blood of the Lamb, without making any mention of their former ſufferings. Our Saviour he was pleaſed to preſerve the Marks of his Sufferings, that he might convince St. <hi>Thomas</hi> of his unbelief, and that he may one day diſcover and ſhew them to thoſe that have pierced him through. But from this inſtance I cannot ſee how we can gather any conſequence; we may ſafely ſay, either that the Martyrs ſhall have no ſuch ſcars, or if they have, they ſhall bring no deformity to their Bodies, nor ſhall they deprive us of any Member or part required in us, to make us perfect. If it ſhould be otherwiſe, we could not be entirely and perfectly happy. After the Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the Bodies of Gods Children ſhall have none of theſe
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:41646:234" rendition="simple:additions"/>imperfections, that Sin hath brought into the World; they ſhall not feel any of the infirmities, unto which the Bodies of Adam and Eve were ſubject, in the eſtate of their inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, for their life was ſenſual and animal like, diſturbed with hunger, thirſt, and wearineſs, therefore they had need of nouriſhment and drink, and eſpecially of the Fruits of the Tree of Life, to ſupply ſo much of their radical humor, as was decayed and conſumed by their natural heat. I conceive alſo, that they ſtood in want of reſt and ſleep; and although God would have protected them from all dangerous accidents, if they had continued in their inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity; if we conſider them in themſelves, without any ſuch protection, they might have been injured by fire and ſword, and burned with the heat of the ſcorching Sun. But it ſhall be otherwiſe with the Bodies of the Righteous, after the Reſurrection, they ſhall not be ſubject to any infirmity, they ſhall be free from pain, wearineſs, and from the ſenſe of any diſpleaſure, as the holy Spirit promiſeth, they ſhall hunger nor thirſt no more; the Sun ſhall not beat upon them, nor any heat incommode them. It is not to be doubted, but that a glorified Body ſhall enjoy all the perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that a humane Body is capable of; and that the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt and rareſt Beauties on Earth, are but difform objects, in compariſon of the Celeſtial, which ſhall never change nor fade away, no accident ſhall ever be able to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy or diminiſh them. The years, ages, and thouſand of ages, ſhall not imprint upon our glorious faces, the leaſt wrinkle, we ſhall always be young and luſty, as a precious Stone that preſerves its Luſter and Beauty without altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and as the Sun that never decreaſeth in light and heat. Theſe glorified Bodies ſhall caſt off all groſs and heavy qualities, that incline them to the Earth, ſo that they ſhall be more nimble then the Eagles, and ſhall be able to fly up as quick as the fire. St. <hi>Paul</hi> intends to teach us this truth, when he tells us, that this Body is ſown an earthly and a ſenſual Body, but it ſhall riſe again an heavenly and a ſpiritual Body; we are not ſo to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand theſe words, as to think that God will change
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:41646:234" rendition="simple:additions"/>them into Spirits, or into ſuch uncompoſed bodies, as are the Heavens, for they ſhall yet be made up of fleſh and bones, and they ſhall have all the eſſential parts of an humane Body, as we have already taken notice; but I conceive that they are named ſpiritual and heavenly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they ſhall have no more the groſs and earthy quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and they ſhall live no more a Senſitive and an ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal life. In a word, they ſhall need no more meat or drink, than the Stars and Celeſtial Bodies, no more than the holy Angels of God.</p>
            <p>I confeſs, that our Lord Jeſus Chriſt aſcended up into Heaven in a cloud, not becauſe that a Cloud was neceſſary to uphold and keep up his glorious Body; for if in the eſtate of his infirmity and humiliation, this divine Body was able to walk upon the waves of the Sea, without ſink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, by the aſſiſtance of his divine Nature, how much more ſince its glorification, ſhall it be able to aſcend up on high, and to go whither he liſteth. If the help of any Creature had been neceſſary to uphold him, he might have had Legions of Immortal Angels to carry him up, but Chriſt needed not to be aſſiſted, neither by a Body, nor a Spirit, nor by any other Creature. This Cloud therefore that appeared at his Aſcention, was no token of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity of his humane Nature, it did rather manifeſt the glory and magnificence of his Divine Majeſty, unto which this precious Body was united perſonally. God hath of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten revealed himſelf, attended by a Cloud, as upon Mount <hi>Sina,</hi> in the Ark of the Covenant, at the Dedication of <hi>Solomone</hi> Temple; therefore that Cloud in which God was pleaſed to diſcover himſelf, is ſtiled, <hi>The Glory of God,</hi> that is, the Sign and viſible expreſſion of his Glorious Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and Divine Majeſty. Let us therefore gather from hence, that the Cloud which attended upon the glorified Body of Jeſus Chriſt, was no needful help to carry him up to Heaven, but as it were a Chariot of Triumph, to cauſe him to go with more glory and pomp. The Bodies of the Saints, after the Reſuriection, ſhall ſhine and be full of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:41646:235" rendition="simple:additions"/>they ſhall not only have ſome ſuperficial ſplendor up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their Countenance or Skin, as <hi>Moſes</hi> when he had been with God forty days and forty nights in the Holy Mountain, but they ſhall ſhine within and without, as a true Diamond, that caſts abroad on all ſides its light and flames. So that it ſhall happen to them, as it happened to our Saviour upon Mount <hi>Tabor,</hi> for it is ſaid, that his Garments became White as the Light. In the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, at the time of our Transfiguration, our bodies that are but the Garments of our Immortal Souls, ſhall be as clear as the Light, and as bright as the Celeſtial Globes. I ſpeak here nothing, but what the Prophet <hi>Daniel</hi> ſaith, before me, <hi>Daniel</hi> 12. <hi>They that be wiſe, ſhall ſhine as the brightneſs of the Firmament, and they that turn many to righteouſneſs, as the Stars for ever and ever.</hi> And our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour aſſures us, Math. 23. <hi>That the Children of God ſhall ſhine in the Kingdom of their Father as the Sun.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe glorified Bodies, ſhall never corrupt nor putrify, but they ſhall be for ever uncorruptible. Therefore St. <hi>Paul</hi> aſſures us, that <hi>the Corruptible muſt put on incorrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> ſo that I may ſafely affirm, that their glory ſhall be more durable than that of the Sun, or of the Moon, or of the Stars; for although theſe Celeſtial Bodies never cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt, out of any inward principle; although there can be no alteration happen to them, neither from their eſſential form, nor from the properties that come from it, nor from any other inherent quality, they ſhall nevertheleſs corrupt, out of an external principle, for the Almighty hand of God which made them, ſhall change and alter them, as the royal Prophet tells us, in 102 <hi>Pſalm, The heavens ſhall periſh, but thou ſhalt endure, yea, all of them ſhall wax old like a garment, as a veſture ſhalt thou change them, and they ſhall be changed,</hi> 1 Pet. 5. Unto this St. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> doth very well agree, <hi>The Heavens,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>ſhall paſs away with a great noiſe.</hi> Where as the glorified Bodies ſhall never corrupt, neither by any internal principle, nor by their eſſential form, nor by the properties and accidents
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:41646:235" rendition="simple:additions"/>that flow from it, nor by any external cauſe, nor by any accident whatſoever, that can be imagined, for the Almighty hand of God, ſhall make them never to marr them again. From hence it follows, that they ſhall Die no more, but ſhall continue Immortal, for with incorruption they muſt put on Immortality; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when our Saviour ſpeaks of the eſtate of the glorified Saints, <hi>Luk.</hi> 20. he ſaith, not only that <hi>they ſhall not Die, but that they cannot Die any more, becauſe they ſhall be like the Angels, being the Children of the Reſurrection.</hi> In this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts the difference between them and thoſe whom God hath raiſed up, already mentioned in the Old and New Teſtament.</p>
            <p>For they were forced to return to their ſenſual life, to eat and drink, and therefore they were again ſubject to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption and Death; but at the day of the general Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, <hi>whatſoever is Mortal, ſhall be ſwallowed up by Life;</hi> therefore St. <hi>Paul</hi> applies to this glorious day, the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment of this Prophecy, <hi>Death is ſwallowed up into Victory:</hi> and he brings in theſe who ſhall be cloathed with this Immortal Glory, braving Death and the Grave, in this triumphing Language, <hi>O Death! where is thy Victory? O Grave I where is thy Sting?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In ſhort, to make us ſenſible, that our Bodies ſhall put on all the richeſt and moſt noble qualities that can be imagined, and to expreſs all in a word, the Holy Ghoſt aſſures us, that they ſhall bear the Image of the Son of God, and be made conformable to his glorious Body, St <hi>Paul</hi> declares this Truth, in the 15 Chap. of the firſt of the <hi>Corinth. The firſt Man,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>was of the Earth Earthly, the ſecond Man was the Lord from Heaven; as is the Earthy, ſuch are they that are are Earthy; and as is the Heavenly, ſuch are they alſo that are Heavenly; and as we have born the Image of the Earthy, we ſhall alſo bear the Image of the Heavenly.</hi> And in <hi>Philip.</hi> 3. he ſaith, <hi>we wait for the Lord Jeſus from Heaven, who ſhall change our vile Body, that it may be like to his glorious Body;</hi> from hence you may gather Chriſtians,
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:41646:236" rendition="simple:additions"/>that at the rebuilding of this little Temple of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, there ſhall happen no ſuch thing, as at the rearing up of the Temple of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> for when that was Rebuild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, at the return from the <hi>Babiloniſh</hi> Captivity; they that had ſeen the former Temple, and its wonderful glory, wept aloud, ſo that their weeping interrupted the others expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of joy and gladneſs. At the Reſtauration of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of our Bodies, nothing ſhall be heard but Songs of Triumph and Jubile. Such as have ſeen, with the eyes of Faith, Mans Body, as it was in the eſtate of its integrity, in the earthly Paradiſe, ſhall not be then ſorry, that it hath been defaced by Sin, and deſtroyed by Death; they ſhall not be ſorry for any thing that is paſſed; they ſhall not be able to wiſh for any increaſe of happineſs and glory for the future, for at the very inſtant of its riſing from the Grave, it ſhall be raiſed to its higheſt Splendor, Happineſs, and Magnificence, ſo that it ſhall be truly ſaid, <hi>That the glory of this Second Houſe, ſhall be greater than that of the Firſt,</hi> Hag. 2.</p>
            <p>Now that we have treated ſufficiently, of ſuch as ſhall riſe from their Graves, it remains, that we take a view of them, whoſe Bodies ſhall never be laid in the Duſt, and who ſhall be alive at Chriſts coming down from Heaven: for that purpoſe. St. <hi>Paul</hi> informs us, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. <hi>Behold I ſhew you a Myſtery, we ſhall not all ſleep, but we ſhall be all changed in a moment, at the twinckling of an eye, at the ſound of the laſt trumpet;</hi> and he ſpeaks in this manner to the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> 1 Theſ. 4. <hi>For this we ſay unto you, by the word of the Lord, that we which are alive, and remain unto the coming of the Lord, ſhall not prevent them which are aſleep, for the Lord himſelf ſhall deſcend from Heaven with a ſhout, with the voice of the Archangel, and with the Trump of God, and the Dead in Chriſt ſhall riſe firſt, then we which are alive and remain, ſhall be caught up together with them in the Clouds, to meet the Lord in the Air, and we ſhall ever be with the Lord, wherefore comfort one another with theſe words,</hi> I know very well that St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells the Hebrews, <hi>that it is appointed
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:41646:236" rendition="simple:additions"/>unto all Men once to Die.</hi> Therefore I conceive that this great change that ſhall be made in the Bodies of them that ſhall be then alive, ſhall be a kind of Death, for Chriſt will deſtroy and aboliſh altogether in them, all corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and inclination to Mortality. And when he ſhall change the Bodies of the Reprobates, he will make them like to the other Reprobates, whom he ſhall fetch out of their Graves; he will make them Immortal, that they may be eternally tormented in Hell. But he will cauſe the Bodies of Believers then alive, to be like the other Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, that they may all partake and enjoy the ſame glory and eternal Bliſs.</p>
            <p>Chriſtians, in what condition ſoever you be in, ſeriouſly apply to your ſelves, theſe Divine Conſolations, you that are grieved to ſee your Bodies maimed and deprived of one of your Members, of your Eyes, Hearing, or of ſome other of your ſenſes, whether you be ſo born, or whether ſuch a privation hath happened unto you by a Diſeaſe, by a Miſchance, or by any other Means, rejoyce and comfort your ſelves with this aſſurance, that you ſhall ſee one day, this wretched Body reſtored to a perfect eſtate, to a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection that ſhall never be loſt; you that fret and vex your ſelves, to behold now old Age and Sickneſs have diſfigured your Bodies, what breaches and ruines they have cauſed in you; Comfort your ſelves in expectation of this glorious Reſurrection, which ſhall ſupply this decayed and langui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing Body, with new ſtrength and vigor, and adorn it with a perfect beauty, and an eternal glory.</p>
            <p>And you whom Death undermines, and intends ſhortly to lay in the Duſt, grieve not at it, for you ſhall looſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at preſent, but you ſhall find it again, at the great day of the Reſurrection. When <hi>Joſeph</hi> died, he comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded his Brethren, concerning his Bones, that they ſhould carry them out of <hi>Egypt</hi> into the Land of <hi>Canaan.</hi> Now our Bones are the Bones of Jeſus Chriſt, our true <hi>Joſeph:</hi> Therefore he will command his Angels to gather them up ſafe, he himſelf will have a care to preſerve them, at the
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:41646:237" rendition="simple:additions"/>great Morne of the Reſurrection, he ſhall fetch them out of their Graves, as out of an <hi>Egypt,</hi> out of an Houſe of Bondage, and will carry them to his Celeſtial <hi>Canaan.</hi> When the Tabernacle was taken in pieces, the High-Prieſt did deliver every piece in charge to the Levites, ſo that when they were to ſet it up again, there was nothing wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. Likewiſe our Saviour hath given in charge, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered by retail, every Member and part of our Bodies; theſe Tabernacles which he hath Conſecrated for himſelf to our Graves, therefore they ſhall all be found again at the Reſurrection, without the leaſt imperfection. Theſe Tabernacles ſhall not only be found entire, but they ſhall be beautified with a far greater Glory and Splend or than before</p>
            <p>There is none but would be glad to lay himſelf down to ſleep in his Bed, and pull off his garments willingly, if he were certain to be more healthy, and to find his garments freſher and more beautiful in the Morning, if he were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, that inſtead of old rags, he were to cloath and put on a royal attire, and moſt m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort thy ſelf, believing Soul, and rejoyce in God thy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer; caſt off willingly this Garment that is ſo incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious and troubleſome to thee; forſake this wretched Body, undermined by ſickneſs and diſeaſes, and conſumed by time. Sleep quietly in the Lord Jeſus, and repoſe thy ſelf in his Boſome, for when thou ſhalt wake again at the ſound of the Archangels Trumpet, thou ſhalt find this garment whither then Snow, and as bright as the Light; grieve not to ſee this craſy dwelling fall to pieces and rot, for God ſhall build it up again with his own hands, and convert it into his Temple, and a pavillion of his glory.

Weep not, for thy beautiful eyes that are ſhut, nor for the reſt of thy Senſes that are loſt, nor for the Members of thy Body that conſume away one after another; for with theſe ſame eyes that have loſt, or ſhall ſhortly looſe the ſight of the day light, thou ſhalt behold a Divine Light, that ſhall ſhine eternally in Heaven; thou ſhalt behold the face of the King of Kings, and all the Glory and Magnificence of his Kingdom, with theſe ears that are deaf, and that ſhall ſhortly be ſtopped, thou ſhalt hear with tranſports of Joy, the raviſhing harmonies of the Saints, and the Songs of the Bleſſed Angels, with this ſtammering Tongue, which is to looſe the faculty of Speech; thou ſhalt ſing with a loud voice the praiſes of Almighty God, in the glorious com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of the Church triumphant; with theſe unſteddy hands that can ſcarce hold any thing, thou ſhalt one day receive Immortal Palmes, and Golden Viols, which thou ſhalt never quit with theſe feet that are dying, and that can ſcarce hold thee up, thou ſhalt follow the Lamb whither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he goeth, and thou ſhalt walk about the Streets of the heavenly <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and this ſame body that is going to rot, and to be turned to duſt, ſhall one day ſhine as the Firmament, and as the Sun in its greateſt ſplendor.</p>
            <p>What deſireſt thou more Chriſtian Soul for thy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, what addition can there be made to thine happineſs? for thou art going to the fruition of eternal Joyes, and of endleſs pleaſures in Heaven. In the mean while, thy Body ſhall endure no pain, nor grief; and God will ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly raiſe it up again from this deep ſleep, that begins to dull thy ſenſes, and cloſe thine eye lids. Shortly God will publiſh the year of the great Jubile, all the Priſons of Death ſhall be then opened, and the Priſoners ſhall be ſet at liberty. Thou ſhalt ſhortly hear the found of the laſt Trump that ſhall rouſe thee out of the duſt, and cauſe thee to appear in the preſence of thy great Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. Thou leaveſt a wretched Body, full of darkneſs and corruption, aſſaulted by Death on all ſides, but it ſhall
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:41646:238" rendition="simple:additions"/>ſhortly be made uncorruptible, immortal, and adorned with Light and Glory.</p>
            <p>Let therefore thy Heart rejoyce, thy Tongue be glad, and thy fleſh reſt in hope, for the Lord will not leave thee always in the Grave, he will not ſuffer thee to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue for ever in duſt and corruption, he will not only diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover to thee the ways of life, but he will ſhortly come down himſelf from Heaven, for to lead thee thither.</p>
            <p>When Death ſhould be already upon thy lips, when ſhe ſhould be ready to lay thee in thy Grave, let not this diſturb the quiet of thy Soul, nor the peace of thy Conſcience, let it not ſhake thy precious Faith that keeps thee up, nor drive thee from the Author of thy Bleſſed hope fixed in Heaven, where Jeſus Chriſt is entered as thy forerunner; in ſhort, when thy Body ſhould be all cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with ſores and boiles, as that of <hi>Job, Job</hi> 19 when it ſhould all fall to pieces before thine eyes, let nothing hinder thee from crying out with this patient Man, <hi>I know that my redeemer liveth, and that he ſhall ſtand at the latter day upon the Earth, and though after my skin, worms deſtroy this Body, yet in my fleſh ſhall I ſee God, whom I ſhall ſee for my ſe f and mine Eyes ſhall behold and not another.</hi> And with St. <hi>Paul,</hi> Phil. 3. <hi>We look from Heaven for the Saviour the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who ſhall change our vile body, that it may be faſhioned like unto his glorious Body, according to the mighty working, whereby he is able even to ſubdue all things unto himſelf.</hi>

               <p>O <hi>Eternal and Divine Word! by whom all things were Created, and without whom was not any thing made, that was made; Thou haſt not only created our Souls, and faſhioned our Bodies with thy skilful hands, but when they were miſerably loſt and corrupted with Sin, thou haſt been plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to redeem both our Souls and Bodies with thy moſt precious Blood, and to reſtore thy glorious Image in us. This wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Body is but an Earthen Veſſel; yet thou haſt incloſed in it, the richeſt Treaſuries of Life and Light. Thou haſt appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it to be the Temple of the Holy Ghoſt, and a noble Pavil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion of the Godhead, to participate with the Soul in the eternal happineſs of thy Kingdom. I feel my ſtrength failing me, and this Earthly Tabernacle decaying every day, and every hour, ſo that I am certain that it ſhall ſhortly fall to duſt. But Lord I am ſufficiently comforted with the knowledge, that if the outward Man decays, the inward is renewed day by day. If this wretched Body falls down by Death, thou ſhalt raiſe it up again at the general Reſurrection. My Lord, and my God, thou art ſufficiently able, for all power is given to thee in Heaven and in Earth, and in the depths of the Sea. As the Father raiſeth and quickneth the Dead, thou doſt alſo quicken them whom thou haſt choſen. Thou haſt faſhioned my Body of Duſt, and created this Duſt of nothing; and ſhalt not thou be able of the ſame duſt, into which this my Body ſhall be turned by Death, to make and faſhion it again: Thou haſt by thine Almighty power, created my Soul and infuſed it into this Body, and canſt thou not return it again,
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:41646:239" rendition="simple:additions"/>when it ſhall pleaſe thee, to live for ever in a more bleſſed ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety than ever it hath been before? O Prince of Life, Death hath ſufficiently felt thy great and overflowing power. It in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to ſwallow thee up, but thou haſt ſwallowed it up in a glorious manner into Victory. Thou haſt been dead, but thou art returned to life, and thou liveſt for ever and ever. And now thou holdeſt in thy hands the Keys of Death. Thou openeſt and ſhuteſt up thy black Dungeon at thy pleaſure; Thou killeſt and makeſt alive, thou caſteſt into the Grave, and fetcheſt up again. Lord Jeſus, who art the Reſurrection and the Life, as thou haſt an ability to cauſe my Body to come out of the Duſt, thou art willing and reſolved to take it out again, for thou haſt promiſed to awake with the ſound of the Archangels Trump, and to lead away with thee all them that ſleep in thee, and repoſe themſelves upon thee, when thou ſhalt come from Heaven with thy powerful Angels, at the great day of thy Triumph, and at the Crowning of thy Spouſe, all the Priſons of Death ſhall be opened, and the priſoners ſet at liberty. It ſhall not be long O Lord, before thou wilt cauſe the laſt Trumpet to ſound, to publiſh and proclaime the great Day of Reſt and Joy. Thou ſhalt then put us in poſſeſſion of all the advantages which we have loſt. Thou ſhalt command the Sea, the Earth, and the Grave, to reſtore all the Bodies which they have ſwallowed up, and they ſhall readily obey thee. Thy mighty word that Created the World and ſuſtains it, ſhall be heard in our very Graves, and at that inſtant we ſhall go out to appear before thy dreadful Tribunal. We ſhall not go out in the ſame manner as</hi> Lazarus <hi>with our winding ſheets about us; we ſhall leave in the Grave all tokens of our former infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities. Thou ſhalt not only draw our Bodies out of their Tombs, but thou ſhalt make them more beautiful, more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and glorious than ever they were before, ſo that we are able to ſay for a truth,</hi> I hat the glory of this ſecond Houſe, ſhall be greater than the glory of the former, <hi>For thou ſhalt change this vile body, and make it like to thy glorious body; this corruptible ſhall put on incorruption, and whatſoever is mortal in us, ſhall be overcome and ſwallowed up by life. With
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:41646:239" rendition="simple:additions"/>theſe ſame languiſhing eyes I ſhall behold thee upon a Cloud of the Heavens, and a Throne of fire; with theſe ears that are going to be ſtopt, I ſhall hear the ſound of the laſt Trump, and the Songs of the bleſſed Angels; with this Tongue that can ſcarce ſpeak and move, I ſhall ſing forth thine Eternal and Divine praiſes with the Church Triumphing; with theſe dying hands I ſhall embrace and take hold of thee; with theſe feet that are already in the Grave, I ſhall follow thee whither ſoever thou goeſt, and walk about the ſtreets of the new Jeruſalem; this ſame Body that is now dropping into the rotten Grave, ſhall be carried up into Heaven, to ſhine as the Stars, or as the Sun for ever and ever.

But firſt, I muſt ſay ſomething of the entire and perfect deſtruction of all our Enemies, and repreſent unto you the overthrow and the fatal end of Death.</p>
            <p>When Jeſus Chriſt ſhall appear again to Judge the World in Righteouſneſs, he ſhall ſit upon a glorious and a moſt ſplendid Throne. <hi>Solomons</hi> magnificent Throne, was but its ſhadow and imperfect Type, he ſhall then ſend
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:41646:240" rendition="simple:additions"/>forth his Angels, who ſhall gather together the Elect with the ſound of a Trumpet from the four parts of the World, and from one end of the Heavens to the other. The ſight of this glorious Saviour, ſhall then fill us with an unſpeakable joy, and cauſe us to burſt forth into this Language, <hi>Iſ.</hi> 25. <hi>Lo this is our God, we have waited for him, and he will ſave us; This is the Lord, we have waited for him, we will be glad and rejoyce in his Salvation.</hi> But when all the kinreds of the Earth ſhall behold this glorious King, in the Clouds of Heaven, with power and great glory, they ſhall lament and ſtrike their Breaſts in deſpair, they ſhall call to the Mountains and Rocks, <hi>Revel.</hi> 6. <hi>Fall upon us, and hide us from the face of him that ſitteth upon the Throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb, for the great day of his wrath is come, who ſhall be able to ſtand?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is then, that the Lord ſhall bring to light the hidden things of darkneſs, and ſhall manifeſt the thoughts of the heart, with the moſt ſecret contrivances. The Books ſhall be opened, not only of the guilty Conſciences, where Satans Image and Deeds ſhall be engraven, but alſo the other Books, where God himſelf hath written with his own finger, all our actions, words, and our moſt ſecret thoughts. All Men ſhall be judged according to the things written in the Books. St. <hi>John</hi> declares this in the 20. of the <hi>Revelations. I ſaw a great White Throne, and him that ſate on it, from whoſe face the Earth and the Heaven fled away, and there was no place for them. And I ſaw the Dead ſmall and great ſtand before God, and the Books were opened, and another Book was opened, which is the Book of Life, and the Dead were judged out of thoſe things which were written in the Books, according to their works.</hi> Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this St. <hi>Paul</hi> agrees, <hi>we muſt all appear before the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Seat of Chriſt, that every one may receive in his Body according as he hath done, whether it be good or evil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are three ſorts of perſons that are to ſtand before this glorious Tribunal, ſuch as never had any other tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher but Nature, who were not acquainted with any other
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:41646:241" rendition="simple:additions"/>Works of God, but of Creation and Providence; for God hath not left himſelf without witneſs in doing good.</p>
            <p>The ſecond ſort have been aſſiſted with a Divine Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation from above, under the Law which hath diſtinctly taught them what Works are pleaſing to God. Theſe may have heard ſomething of a <hi>Meſſias</hi> from the ancient Prophets, they may have ſeen his pourtraiture in the Types and Shadows of <hi>Moſes</hi> ordinances.</p>
            <p>The other ſort have had the Grace of God clearly and plainly revealed unto them, unto whom our Lord Jeſus Chriſt hath brought Life and Immortality to light, through the Goſpel. There are none of theſe perſons if they have lived in Impiety and debauchery, and are dead in impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitency, that ſhall be able to excuſe themſelves in this dreadful day of Judgement. But ſome are more guilty than others, therefore they ſhall be condemned to more greivous Tortures.</p>
            <p>The knowledge that God hath beſtowed upon Man, hath been darkened by the Prince of darkneſs, but it hath not been totally extinct; and that Law which God hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graven in the Soul of Man, hath not been altogether blot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out, but there remains yet ſome relicks. So that there is no Man living that can affirm, that he hath done all the good deeds, which his Conſcience was perſwaded that he ought to perform, and that he hath omitted all the evil acts, of which his Conſcience did convince him. They who have lived and are Dead, without any Law of God revealed unto them, ſhall be judged without the Law. Such ſhall be condemned, for having taken pleaſure in extinguiſhing the remains of their natural light, and in ſmothering the good and rational dictates of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences. They ſhall be condemned becauſe they have abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Heavens favors, and filled themſelves with Gods good Creatures, without returning to him due thanks; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they have not meditated as they ought, upon ſo many ſtately and noble works of nature, nor learned by that means to know God, who hath left in theſe works, ſo many
<pb n="488" facs="tcp:41646:241" rendition="simple:additions"/>impreſſes of his eternal Power and Godhead, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that knowing God, they have not glorified him as God, this St. <hi>Paul</hi> teacheth in theſe words, <hi>As many as have ſinned without Law, ſhall alſo periſh without Law, and as many as have ſinned in the Law, ſhall be judged by the Law; for when the Gentiles which have not the Law, do by nature the things contained in the Law theſe having not the Law, are a Law unto themſelves, which ſhew the work of the Law written in their Hearts, their Conſcience alſo bearing Witneſs, and their thoughts the mean while accuſing, or elſe excuſing one another in the day when God ſhall judge the ſecrets of Men by Jeſus Chriſt, according to the Goſpel,</hi> Rom. 2.</p>
            <p>They that profeſs to know the Law, ſhall be judged by the Law, ſuch as have already heard the Thunders of Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> they ſhall one day feel the Thunderbolts. They ſhall underſtand by experience, what it is to rebel againſt God, and to draw upon themſelves and their guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty heads, the dreadful curſes of Gods Law, <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. <hi>Curſed is every one that continueth not in all things, which are written in the Book of the Law to do them,</hi> Gal. 3. There is no doubt but that the Jews upon whom <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets have ſpent ſo many fruitleſs exhortations to live well, ſhall be puniſhed with more grievous Torments, than the poor Savages, unto whom God never ſent any Meſſuage, who never had any acquaintance with the Commonwealth of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> being ſtrangers from the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, having no hope and being without God in the World, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. For that ſervant who knoweth his Maſters will and doth it not, ſhall be beaten with more ſtripes then him who knoweth it not, <hi>Luke</hi> 12.</p>
            <p>But no people upon Earth have cauſe to expect and dread a more ſevere Sentence, then the wicked Chriſtians, that make profeſſion of knowing God, and believing in Jeſus Chriſt; who nevertheleſs deny him by their Works, and trample under feet the riches of his Grace; how can it otherwiſe be, for ſuch as have heard the Goſpel Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, who have ſeen Jeſus Chriſt as it were Crucified before
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:41646:242" rendition="simple:additions"/>their eyes, and yet have made no advantage of all this, they ought to be puniſhed in another manner, than the bare Auditors of <hi>Moſes,</hi> that never ſaw the <hi>Meſſias</hi> but afar off, and in the ſhadows of the Ceremonial Law. Take notice of theſe Divine ex preſſions of St. <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Hebrews, He that deſpiſed</hi> Moſes <hi>Law, died without Mercy, under two or three witneſſes; of how much ſorer puniſhment, ſuppoſe ye, ſhall he be thought worthy, who hath trodden un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der foot the Son of God, and hath counted the Blood of the Covenant, wherewith he was Sanctified, an unholy thing, and hath done deſpite unto the Spirit of Grace? For we know him that hath ſaid, Vengeance belongeth unto me, I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence ſaith the Lord; and again, the Lord ſhall judge his people. It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving God.</hi> Therefore when St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of ſuch as obey not the Goſpel, he ſaith, <hi>That they ſhall be puniſhed with eternal Puniſhments from the preſence of God, and from the glory of his power.</hi> And our Saviour teacheth us, that ſuch as reject ſo great Salvation, ſhall be puniſhed more grievouſly than the moſt abominable Sinners unto whom it was never declared. Therefore when he ſends forth his Apoſtles to Preach, he tells them, whoſoever ſhall not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive you, and hear your words, when ye depart out of that Houſe or City, ſhake off the duſt of your feet; ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily I ſay unto you, it ſhall be more tollerable for the Land of <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrha</hi> in the day of Judgement, than for that City. Likewiſe, when he upbraids the Cities which had not believed in him, for their unbelief and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitency, becauſe they were not converted at the Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his Goſpel, and at the ſight of his glorious Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, <hi>Math.</hi> 11. he tells them, <hi>Wo unto thee</hi> Chorazin, <hi>wo unto thee</hi> Bethſaida, <hi>for if the mighty works which were done in you, had been done in</hi> Tyre <hi>and</hi> Sidon, <hi>they would have repented long ago in ſackcloth and aſhes. But I ſay un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, it ſhall be more tollerable for</hi> Tyre <hi>and</hi> Sidon, <hi>at the day of Judgement then for you. And thou</hi> Capernaum, <hi>which art exalted unto Heaven, ſhalt be brought down to Hell; for
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:41646:242" rendition="simple:additions"/>if the mighty works which have been done in thee, had been done in</hi> Sodom, <hi>it would have remained unto this day, but I ſay unto you, that it ſhall be more tollerable for the Land of</hi> Sodom <hi>in the day of Judgement then for thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The great Judge of the World, ſhall place at his left hand, all wicked Souls which have lived without any fear of God, and without expreſſing Charity to the Members of his Myſtical Body, and ſhall pronounce to them this dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Sentence, <hi>Depart from me ye Curſed, to Eternal Fire, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for the Devil and his Angels, for I was an hungrey, and ye gave me no Meat, I was thirſty, and ye gave me no Drink, I was a ſtranger and ye took me not in, Naked and ye cloathed me not, ſick and in Priſon, and ye viſited me not; verily I ſay unto you, in as much as ye did it not to one of the leaſt of theſe, ye did it not to me.</hi> But the faithful who have decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red their Faith, by a good and holy Life, and by works of Charity and Mercy, he will place at his right hand, and in the Preſence of God, and all his holy Angels, he ſhall ſay unto them, <hi>Come ye Bleſſed of my Father, inherit the Kingdom prepared for you, from the beginning of the World, for I was an hungrey, and ye gave me Meat, I was thirſty, and ye gave me Drink, I was a Stranger, and ye took me in, Naked, and ye cloathed me, I was ſick, and ye viſited me, I was in Priſon, and ye came unto me; verily I ſay unto you, in as much as ye have done it unto one of the leaſt of theſe my Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, ye have done it unto me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There be ſome that make this queſtion, what ſign ſhall precede immediately before, or accompany the coming of Chriſt in the World? Our Saviour hath given occaſion to this demand, for when he ſpeaks of the things that are to happen about the time of his glorious Coming, he ſaith, <hi>That the Sun ſhall be darkened, that the Moon ſhall not give light, that the Stars ſhall fall from Heaven, and that the powers of the Heavens ſhall be ſhaken, and that then ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in Heaven, the Sign of the Son of Man,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some imagine; that this Sign of the Son of Man, is the Sign of the Croſs, which ſhall appear in the air. This
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:41646:243" rendition="simple:additions"/>opinion in it ſelf is harmleſs, but in regard that it hath no foundation in holy Scripture, I am not to inſiſt upon it. Others believe, that it ſhall be the Fire with which Jeſus Chriſt ſhall burn the Earth, diſſolve the Elements, and puniſh unbelievers. This conceit is grounded upon St. <hi>Pauls</hi> words to the <hi>Theſſal.</hi> 2. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1. <hi>It is a righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous thing with God to recompenſe tribulation to them that trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble you, and to you who are troubled, reſt with us, when the Lord Jeſus ſhall be revealed from Heaven with his mighty Angels in flaming fire, taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the Goſpel of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Others conceive, that this Sign of the Son of Man, is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe, but the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, bearing and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering the print of the nails in his hands and feet, and the wound of the Spear in his ſide. This they gather from theſe words of the firſt of the <hi>Revel. Behold he cometh with Clouds, and every eye ſhall ſee him, and they alſo which pierced him.</hi> There be others yet, that take it in another ſence, and that believe that there ſhall be no particular Sign, but that we muſt underſtand by this Sign of the Son of Man, all thoſe things which ſhall declare the end of the World, and the coming of Jeſus Chriſt to judge the quick and the dead. If we take the words in this manner, there will be an excellent alluſion to that which is commonly prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed, when Kings and Princes make their publick entrance into great Cities, for their coming in is proclaimed by the ſound of a Trumpet, and by the attendants of Majeſty, a Train and Pomp that uſually accompanies it. In the ſame manner, the glorious coming of Jeſus Chriſt, ſhall be known, by the ſound of the Archangels Trumpet, and by all the Signs and wonderful alterations which ſhall ſuddenly happen in the Heavens. This laſt opinion is very likely, and the former advanceth nothing contrary to the analogy of Faith. Therefore in harmleſs matters, which are controverted, and not plainly decided by the Word of God, we leave to every pious Soul, a liberty to chuſe that which it likes beſt.</p>
            <p>Some inquire further, If it be true, that the Souls of the
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:41646:243" rendition="simple:additions"/>Damned go down into Hell immediately, after their egreſs out of the Body, and if they are tormented in a Fire that goeth not out, whereof the heat never leſſens, as the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion teacheth, and as we may ſee in the Parable of the rich Glutton; doth it not follow, that theſe wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es are already judged? How is it therefore that the Son of God will judge them again at the laſt day, and ſend them to an everlaſting burning prepared for the Devil and his Angels; I anſwer, Firſt, That it is no abſurdity to ſay, that one Sentence ſhall be pronounced twice, for Men are wont to read the Sentence of Doom to the Priſoner, before he is taken out of Priſon, afterwards the ſame Sentence is publiſhed before all the people, at the time of execution: Likewiſe when the Souls of the Wicked go out of their wretched Bodies, God pronounces to them the Sentence of his Death; But when Jeſus Chriſt ſhall ſit upon the Throne of his Glory; he ſhall publiſh the ſame Sentence, before all the Men of the World, and all the Angels of Heaven. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, that Sentence was never pronounced, but to the Soul, but then it ſhall be declared both to the Soul and Body, and both together ſhall be ſent to the everlaſting burning, from whence they ſhall never be reprieved. From hence therefore Chriſtians, you may gather, that there are three degrees of Puniſhments or Torments to the Wicked; for in this Life they have a Worm that knaws their Bowels and Heart, and a kind of Hell that Torments their Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. At the going of their Souls out of the World, they are caſt headlong into the Eternal flames of Hell, where they ſuffer unſpeakable Torments; at that time their Bodies are ſenſeleſs in their Graves, as the Bodies of the righteous. But at this laſt and dreadful day of Judgement, as the Grave ſhall reſtore all the Dead Bodies, Hell, which is the place deſigned for the Torment of the Damn'd ſhall give up all the Souls that are tormented in its flames, and theſe curſed Souls ſhall be remitted to their miſerable Bodies, to ſuffer the pangs of an eternal Death, <hi>Revel.</hi> 20. Thus they ſhall be caſt in Body and Soul into the bottomleſs pit, where there is weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:41646:244" rendition="simple:additions"/>and gnaſhing of teeth. At that time the Beaſt, the falſe Prophet, and all the Enemies of God and of his Church, ſhall be caſt alive into the Lake burning with fire and brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, which is the ſecond Death, <hi>Revel.</hi> 19.10, 11. And when all theſe Offenders ſhall be executed, the Executio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners themſelves ſhall be puniſhed for their Crimes, when the Damned ſhall be caſt into eternal Tortures, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils and infernal furies ſhall be ſent after them, as it is ſaid, <hi>The Devil who ſeduced the Nations, ſhall be caſt into the lake of fire and Brimſtone, where the Beaſt and the falſe Prophet are, and they ſhall be tormented day and night for ever and ever, Revel.</hi> 20. What a dreadful ſight is it to behold all thoſe Roaring Lions; thoſe furious Dragons in their rage, vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting forth fire and flames? What a joyful ſpectacle ſhall this be, to the Children of God, to look upon theſe infernal Devils, bound faſt with thoſe Chains, which they ſhall never be able to break, and ſhut up in this bottomleſs pit, out of which they ſhall never be releaſed.</p>
            <p>Our Lord ſhall caſt into this Lake of fire and brimſtone, and ſhut up in this bottomleſs pit, not only the Devil and his Angels, the Beaſt and the falſe Prophet, and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally all wicked Souls and unbelievers, but he ſhall caſt therein alſo Death and the Grave, or rather, he ſhall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boliſh them for ever. As <hi>Joſuah</hi> when he conquered the Kings of the <hi>Amorites,</hi> he never killed them, until ſuch time as he had overcome all his Enemies. Likewiſe our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, our true <hi>Joſhua,</hi> hath encountered with Death upon the Croſs, and overcome it by his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, but he will not deſtroy it altogether, until the laſt day, when he ſhall come to judge the World. Then to perfect all his glorious victories, he ſhall deſtroy this laſt Enemy, this deſtroyer of his Brethren, and of his Members, ſo that <hi>Death ſhall be no more.</hi> It ſhall be no more for the wicked, they ſhall ſeek it in vain, to be freed from their Torments. It ſhall flie away from them as a ſhadow, that departs and is no more to be found, Death ſhall be no more for Gods Children, for it ſhall never diſturb their Reſt and Happineſs,</p>
            <pb n="431" facs="tcp:41646:244" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p>If the old Serpent could enter into Paradiſe, we ſhould fear his temptations, and inflamed Darts; and if Death did continue in its Empire and Command, we ſhould dread its approaches; but then it ſhall not have the leaſt power, it ſhall be totally aboliſhed; All the living ſhall become immortal: And although God will not deſtroy the Being, nor take away the malice of the Devil; yet to us he ſhall be as if he were not, for he ſhall never be able to break his Chains, nor to eſcape out of his Priſon; and between him and us, there ſhall be depths that can never be filled: So that as <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> when he caſt his Eyes upon <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and the <hi>Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians</hi> who purſued the frighted <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> he told them, <hi>Stand ſtill, and ſee the ſalvation of the Lord, which he will ſhew to you to day; for the Egyptians whom ye have ſeen to day, ye ſhall ſee them again no more for ever.</hi> Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, when we think upon Satan, and all his infernal Armies that purſue you; We may ſay with confidence, Settle your minds, Chriſtian Souls, and with the Eye of Faith, behold the Salvation of the Lord; for theſe helliſh furies that have perſecuted us ſo long, ſhall be reduced to that eſtate, that they ſhall not be able to do you the leaſt diſpleaſure, or to give you any appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion; God is going to drown them in the Red Sea of his wrath; and to ſhut them up for ever, in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomleſs pit of his juſt revenge. So that as in the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Paradiſe, there ſhall be neither pain nor ſorrow, nor grief, nor crying, nor ſighs heard. Likewiſe, there ſhall never be any fear nor fright, nor the leaſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larm, but we ſhall live there in a ſetled Peace and quiet for ever.</p>
            <p>It is reported of the Macedonians, that they wept for joy when they beheld their King <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, ſeated in the Throne of <hi>Darius,</hi> and tramp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling under feet, the Pride and Empire of <hi>Perſia.</hi> But how exceeding great ſhall our joy be, when we ſhall behold Jeſus Chriſt our great Monarch, ſitting upon
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:41646:245" rendition="simple:additions"/>the Throne of God, and trampling under feet the pomp of the World, cruſhing the Red Dragon, and all the tyrannical powers of Hell. The Glory of <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> vaniſhed away with his breath. Death deſtroyed all his Trophies; but our Lord ſhall triumph over death it ſelf; It ſhall be the laſt act of his Eternal Juſtice, to deſtroy the deſtroyer and murderer, from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</p>
            <p>At that time there ſhall be no more enemies to encounter with, no evils to be feared, neither ſhall there be any Advantages to be deſired, nor Honors to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, for God will caſt us into the bottomleſs Oce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an of the moſt Divine Pleaſures, and ſhall raiſe us up to the higheſt Glory, that our Nature ſhall be capable of. This Happineſs and this Glory ſhall be infinite in regard of its durance. It ſhall not be like to the Pomp and Magnificence of the Kings and Princes of the World, which vaniſheth away in an inſtant; nor like to the brightneſs of <hi>Moſes</hi> Face, which departed with his life; nor like the transfiguration of Chriſt upon mount <hi>Tabor,</hi> which ſoon diſappeared; for when it ſhall have continued as many hundred ages as there are Stars in the Firmament; it ſhall then but begin and appear in its riſing, ſo that there we may have juſt cauſe, and more reaſon than <hi>St. Peter,</hi> to ſay, <hi>Lord, it is good for us to be here.</hi> There is no place in the world ſo pleaſant and delightful, but at laſt one ſhall be wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to continue in it, nor company ſo amiable and ſweet, but becomes tedious in time, nor pleaſure ſo ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhing, but grows into diſtaſt. The greateſt perſons on earth ſigh under the burden of their greatneſs; the brightneſs of their Glory dazles them: When nothing troubles them, they are troubled of their own accord, and the moſt magnificent Triumphs diſturb and wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry them. Oft-times their Heart groans in the midſt of the greateſt rejoycings, and of the publick applau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; they think themſelves more unhappy than thoſe,
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:41646:245" rendition="simple:additions"/>who envy their apparent happineſs, for all that ſhines is not. Gold, the moſt beautiful Roſes are not without their prickles, and many times they hide dangerous Serpents.</p>
            <p>As the Glory and Happineſs of Paradiſe is inſinite, in regard of its Durance, ſo in reſpect of its Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Excellency; for God will not only ſatisfy all our deſires, and anſwer all our expectations, but he will alſo give unto us, above all that we can ask or think.</p>
            <p>Shall I undertake to paint out unto you this Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and perfect Happineſs? When <hi>St. Paul</hi> ſpeaks of theſe Evangelical Myſteries, he aſſures us, that they are things that the Eye of Man hath never ſeen, that his Ear hath never heard, and that never enter'd into his Heart, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. If this is true of the Doctrine, which declares this Glory and Eternal Happineſs; how are we able to comprehend that Glory and Happineſs it ſelf, therefore the ſame Apoſtle tells us in another place, <hi>That God worketh in us abundantly, above that we are able to ask or think,</hi> Eph. 3. I cannot boaſt of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſpoken with God face to face, as <hi>Moſes, Numb.</hi> 11. of having been raviſhed as <hi>St. Paul,</hi> into the third Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. God hath not tranſported me up as <hi>St. John,</hi> into the Celeſtial <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> neither hath he delivered to me as to his Holy Angels, a Reed to mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure the holy City. But when I ſhould have enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed theſe Glorious priviledges, this Divine Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, theſe ſupernatural Elevations, when I ſhould have walked about, and taken a full view of the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtial <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> when I ſhould have been in the company of the <hi>Seraphims,</hi> that fly about God's Throne, when I ſhould have beheld God face to face, although I were the moſt eloquent of all Men, and did ſpeak with the tongues of Angels, and had in my hand the Pencil of an Arch-Angel, I ſhould not dare to undertake to repreſent this exceeding great Glory,
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:41646:246" rendition="simple:additions"/>nor to paint out unto you the brightneſs of that Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Light, wherof the leaſt beam is able to dazle me. <hi>St. Paul</hi> had been near the body of this great Light, he had beheld the Riches and Glory of Paradiſe, yet he confeſſeth that they be things unutterable, not to be expreſſed by any tongue.</p>
            <p>But as thoſe who cannot caſt their eyes directly to look upon the Sun, becauſe that it dazles them with its exceeding great Light, behold its Body with more eaſe and leaſure in the Water, or in a Looking-Glaſs. Thus ſhall we conſider and look upon the Images which God himſelf hath expreſſed for us in his Holy Word, of this Divine brightneſs of Heaven, which we are not able otherwiſe to comprehend: for God hath dealt with us, as a Father doth with his young Babes, who babbles with them, and repreſents to them the light of the un, with a black Coal. Or as the Aſtrologers, who repreſent the Heavenly Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtellations by the Figures of Birds, of four-footed Beaſts, and of creeping things.</p>
            <p>For nothing can enter into our underſtanding, but by the door of our Sences, therefore Spiritual and Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtial things, are repreſented under the Notions of Corporal and Earthly Enjoyments, which we paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionately love; and becauſe there is not one thing here below that can expreſs unto us the Glory and Happineſs of Paradiſe; ſo many perfections are not to be found in one only thing: Therefore the Holy Ghoſt gathers together all the Excellencies, Riches, and Beauty, ſcattered about in the inferior Creatures, and borrows the Ideas and Notions of thoſe things that are rareſt and moſt glorious, and that give us the greateſt pleaſure and ſatisfaction, to repreſent unto us Heaven's Glory.</p>
            <p>To begin in the firſt place with the word <hi>Paradiſe;</hi> it ſignifies a delightful and a pleaſant Garden; it is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten made uſe of to expreſs to us the Joys and Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:41646:246" rendition="simple:additions"/>of the life to come, and to make us ſenſible, that what we have loſt by <hi>Adam,</hi> is reſtored to us by <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt,</hi> Our Lord and Saviour, who is goodneſs it ſelf, ſhall beſtow upon us another <hi>Eden,</hi> another Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of pleaſure, watered with living water; in the midſt of it is the Tree of Life, that brings forth its Fruits every moneth; inſtead of an earthly Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe, ſubject to change, we ſhall find an Heavenly, and an Unchangeable Paradiſe. The earthly Paradiſe is no more to be ſeen, it is thought that it was ſwallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up and deſtroyed by the Waters and Deluge; but the Heavenly Paradiſe can never be deſtroyed by the moſt furious Fire, nor by the moſt ſwelling Waves. It is above all the Winds and Storms, and Tempeſts; therefore <hi>St. Peter</hi> aſſures us, <hi>That it is an incorruptible inheritance that fadeth not away.</hi> It hath no need of an ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Water, for it is watered every where with the River of living Water, that proceeds from the Throne of God and the Lamb. And whereas Cherubims, arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a flaming Sword, ſtood at the entrance of the Earthly Paradiſe, to hinder <hi>Adam</hi> from approaching near to the Tree of Life, and from gathering of its Fruits. Now whole Legions of Cherubims are to carry us up upon their wings, to the true Tree of Life, which ſtands in the midſt of the Heavenly Paradiſe; and Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt himſelf, the Prince of all the Angels, of all the Cherubims and Seraphims, promiſeth to admit us to partake of its delicious Fruits, by theſe bleſſed words, <hi>To him that ſhall overcome, I will give him to eat of the Tree of Life, which is in the midſt of the Paradiſe of God:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is the common cuſtom of Men, to have an high eſteem of beautiful and great Cities, whereof the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings are ſtately, and the Inhabitants many. Therefore the Jews were wont to boaſt of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and to call it <hi>The City perfect in Beauty, the joy of the whole Earth.</hi> Therefore the Holy Ghoſt repreſents unto us, the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:41646:247" rendition="simple:additions"/>and Happineſs of Heaven, by a City which he names <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> And <hi>St. Paul</hi> in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> mentions the ſame compariſon, for when he had ſaid, <hi>That</hi> Abraham <hi>by faith ſojourned in the Land of Promiſe, as in a ſtrange Countrey dwelling in Tabernacles with Iſaack and Jacob, the Heirs with him of the ſame promiſe;</hi> he adds immediately after, <hi>For he looked for a City which hath foundations, whoſe builder and Maker is God,</hi> and a little after, <hi>God is not aſhamed to be called their God, for he hath prepared for them a City,</hi> Heb. 11. And in the 12 Chapter of the ſame Epiſtle, he ſpeaks to Believers in this manner, <hi>Ye are come to mount Sion, and unto the City of the living God, the Heavenly Jeruſalem, and to an innumerable company of Angels.</hi> And elſewhere, <hi>We have no continuing City here below, but we ſeek one to come,</hi> Heb. 13.14.</p>
            <p>God is pleaſed, not only to deſcribe unto us our fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Paradiſe, under the general notion of a City, and of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> but he declares unto us its Heavenly Beauty, its Glory and Magnificence; you cannot find a richer, and a more excellent Image, than that of <hi>St. John,</hi> who himſelf had been a ſpectator of the new <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> and had beheld all its rarities and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; for when the Angel, who had in his hand a Golden Reed, to meaſure this Glorious City, had ſaid unto him, <hi>Come, I will ſhew thee the Spouſe, the wife of the Lamb.</hi> He carried him in the Spirit to an high Mountain, from whence he had a proſpect of that great and Holy City <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> which came down from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven from God, decked as a Spouſe, prepared for her Husband, having the Glory of God and his Light. This faithful witneſs aſſures us, that its Buildings, and the Streets of this bleſſed City, were all of fine Gold, as bright as Chryſtal; its Foundations were of precious Stone; its twelve Gates were twelve Pearls; at each of them ſtood an Angel of God. This Holy City hath no need of the light of the Sun, or of the light of the
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:41646:247" rendition="simple:additions"/>Moon, for the Light of God enlightens it, and the Lamb is the Light thereof; there is no Temple there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, for the Lord God Almighty, and the Lamb are the Temple of it.</p>
            <p>It is our delight to abide in ſtately and magnificent Houſes, and in rich and glorious Palaces; Therefore Paradiſe is expreſſed unto us by a Dwelling, and by a Palace, which God himſelf hath built with his own Hands. This is the Picture that the Royal Prophet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents unto us in the 65 <hi>Pſal.</hi> when he ſpeaks of <hi>God's Houſe, and of the Holy place of his Palace.</hi> And <hi>St. Paul</hi> doth the like in the 1 Cor. 5 Chap. when he ſaith, <hi>We know that if our earthly Houſe of this Tabernacle, were diſſolved, we have a building of God, an Houſe not made with hands, eternal in the Heavens.</hi> And our Saviour, when he was ready to leave the World, he comforts his Apoſtles in this manner, <hi>In my Fathers Houſe there are many Manſions, I go to prepare a place for you.</hi> And <hi>St. John</hi> heard a mighty voice from Heaven, ſaying, <hi>Behold, the Tabernacle of God with Men, he ſhall dwell with them; and they ſhall be his people, and God himſelf ſhall he their God with them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Every one deſires to be rich, there be ſome that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem it their chief Happineſs, therefore the Holy Ghoſt repreſents the Happineſs of Heaven, under the notion of Riches and Treaſures; our Saviour himſelf ſpeaks of it in this manner, in the 6 of <hi>St. Matthew, Lay not up for your ſelves Treaſures upon Earth, where Moth and Ruſt doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and ſteal, but lay up for your ſelves Treaſures in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, where neither Moth nor Ruſt doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor ſteal.</hi> Therefore when the Holy Ghoſt deſcribes Heavens Glory, and menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons Gold, Pearls, and precious ſtones, it hath a regard to this conſideration.</p>
            <p>And becauſe Men are for the moſt part deſirous of Honors, Greatneſs, and Dignities, and that there is
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:41646:248" rendition="simple:additions"/>nothing in the world more eſteem'd, than Scepters Crowns; therefore the Glory of Heaven is expreſs'd by a Kingdom, by Thrones, Crowns, and Triumphs. Our Saviour ſpeaks in this language to his Apoſtles, <hi>To you all who have continued with me in my afflictions; I appoint a Kingdom as my Father hath appointed unto me,</hi> Luk 22. In another place, he ſpeaks to all his Church in general, <hi>Fear not little flock, for it is your Fathers plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to give you the Kingdom,</hi> Luk 20. And at the laſt day he will ſay, Come ye bleſſed of my Father, inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit the Kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the World, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. And to the Angel of his Church in <hi>Smyrns,</hi> and to all faithful Souls, this Divine Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our makes this promiſe, <hi>Be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a Crown of Life,</hi> Revel. 2. And to the Angel of the Church of <hi>Laodicea, To him that over cometh, will I grant to ſit with me in my Throne, even as I alſo overcame, and am ſet down with my Father in his Throne,</hi> Revel. 3. And <hi>St. Paul</hi> tels us, <hi>That we run to obtain an uncorruptible Crown,</hi> 1 Cor. 6. And when he ſaw himſelf at the end of his Race, he cries out, <hi>I have fought the good fight, I have finiſhed my courſe, I have kept the faith, henceforth there is laid up for me a Crown of Righteouſneſs, which the Lord, the righteous Judge ſhall give me at that day, and not to me only, but unto all them alſo that love his appearing,</hi> 2 Tim. 4. And <hi>St. James</hi> ſpeaks in the ſame Language, <hi>Bleſſed is the man that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dureth temptation, for when he is tried, he ſhall receive the Crown of Life, which the Lord hath promiſed to them that love him,</hi> Jam. 1. Finally, we read that the glorified Saints have Palms in their Hands, and Crowns of Gold upon their Heads, and in their Songs of Praiſe, they ſpeak thus to our Saviour <hi>Thou haſt redeemed us to God by thy bloud, out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation, and haſt made us to our God, Kings and Prieſts, and we ſhall reign on the Earth,</hi> Revel. 4.4.</p>

            <p>The great Men of the World delight in gorgeous Apparel, ſome in perfum'd Garments, therefore the Holy Ghoſt condeſcends to this weakneſs of Man, and promiſeth in Heaven Robes, more flagrant than the perfumes of <hi>Arabia;</hi> he promiſeth a Garment whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than Snow, and brighter than the Light it ſelf. And <hi>Solomon</hi> when he conſiders his Spouſe, as the Type of the Church, he ſaith, <hi>The Kings daughter is full of glory within, her clothing is of wrought Gold, ſhe ſhall be brought unto the King in raiment of needle work.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And when God himſelf ſpeaks of the glory of his Church, which he begins now, and will conſummate hereafter; he ſaith, that he adorned her with Gold, Silver, and precious Stones, that he hath clothed her with fine Linnen, with Silk, and Needle-work; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Church ſpeaks in this manner, I will greatly rejoyce in the Lord, my Soul ſhall be joyful in my God, for he hath clothed me with the Garments of Salvation, he hath covered me with the Robes of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, as a Bridegroom decketh himſelf with Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments, and as a Bride adorneth her ſelf with her Jewels. And if you take notice of ſuch as ſtand before the Throne of God, and in the preſence of the Lamb that worſhip him day and night in his Temple, you ſhall find them clothed with long Robes, whitened in the Bloud of the Lamb. Look alſo upon that Glorious Woman of the <hi>Revelations,</hi> the true Type and repreſentation of the Church, and you ſhall ſee her clothed with the Sun, and a Crown of twelve Stars upon her Head. In a word, hearken to the Song of the glorified Saints, and you ſhall hear them ſpeaking to one another, <hi>Let us be glad and rejoyce, and give honor to God, for the Marriage of the Lamb is come, and his Wife hath made her ſelf ready, and to her was granted, that ſhe ſhould be arayed in fine Linnen, clean and white, for the fine Linnen is the righteouſneſs of Saints.</hi>

            <p>Men commonly love good cheer, to partake of ſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Feaſts, therefore the Heavenly Delights are repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to us under the notion of rare Meats, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite Drinks, of Noble Feaſts, and Magnificent Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quets. In this manner, the Royal Prophet ſpeaks of them in the 36 <hi>Pſalm, How excellent is thy loving kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, O God! therefore the children of men put their truſt under the ſhadow of thy wings, they ſhall be abundantly ſatisfied with the fatneſs of thy Houſe, and thou ſhalt make them drink of the River of thy pleaſures.</hi> And in the 65 <hi>Pſalm, Bleſſed is the man whom thou chooſeſt, and cauſeſt to approach unto thee, that he may dwell in thy Courts, he ſhall be ſatisffed with the goodneſs of thy houſe, even of thy holy Temple.</hi> And the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſpeaks in the ſame language, <hi>In this Mountain ſhall the Lord of Hoſts make unto all people, a Feaſt of fat things, a Feaſt of Wine on the Lees, of fat things full of Marrow, of Wines on the Lees, well refined.</hi> This conſideration cauſeth a Doctor in the Goſpel to ſay, <hi>Bleſſed is he that ſhall eat Bread in the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> And our Saviour him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſaith, that many ſhall come from the <hi>Eaſt and from the Weſt, and ſhall ſit at Table in the Kingdom of Heaven with Abraham, Iſaac and Jacob. Ahaſuerus</hi>'s Feaſt continued 180 days, but the Feaſt of which we ſhall be partakers in Heaven, and which hath been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring from the foundation of the World, ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue for all Eternity.</p>
            <p>Of all Feaſts, ſuch as are prepared for Nuptial So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnities, are moſt eſteem'd, when they are for Kings and Princes of the Earth, for in ſuch occaſions there are the greateſt, and the moſt extraordinary rejoycings; therefore the happineſs of Heaven is expreſſed by a Marriage, our Saviour himſelf makes uſe of this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon in the 22 Chapter of <hi>St. Matthew, The King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>is like unto a King which made a Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage for his Son.</hi> This cauſed the glorified Church to ſpeak in this manner, <hi>Let us rejoyce and be glad, and give
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:41646:249" rendition="simple:additions"/>glory to the Lord our God for the Marriage of the Lamb is come.</hi> Finally, The Holy Ghoſt hath Commanded to Write and Record theſe words for ever, <hi>Bleſſed are thoſe that are called to the Marriage-Feaſt of the Lamb.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some perſons are very much delighted with the ſweet and pleaſant Conſorts of Muſick; Therefore the Holy Ghoſt to ſignify unto us, That in Heaven there ſhall be all manner of pleaſures, and nothing wanting, tells us, that about God's Throne, millions of Angels, and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified Saints, ſhall ſing forth the Divine Praiſe. Beſides, it acquaints us with the ſubſtance of their Heavenly Songs; when <hi>Iſaiah</hi> mentions theſe wonderful <hi>Sera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phims,</hi> that fly round about God's Glorious Throne, he ſaith, <hi>That they cry one to another, Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord God of Hoſts, the whole Earth is full of thy glory.</hi> And when <hi>St. John</hi> ſpeaks of thoſe glorified Saints, he ſaith, that they ſtand before this magnificent Throne, playing with their Harps, and ſinging a new Song, that is to ſay, a moſt rare and excellent Song, and that they have always in their mouths the ſong of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and of the Lamb, and that Heaven it ſelf reſounds with their Sacred <hi>Halelujah's,</hi> which ſignifies, <hi>Praiſe God,</hi> or, <hi>Set forth the praiſes of God.</hi> There is no ingenuous Soul but loves Peace and Reſt, for this cauſe, the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and Happineſs of Paradiſe is repreſented under this lovely and pleaſant Notion, as in the 4 Chapter of the <hi>Hebrews, For we which believed, do enter into reſt, as he ſaid, as I have ſworn in my wrath, if they ſhall enter into my reſt; for if Jeſus had given them reſt, then would he not afterward have ſpoken of another day, there remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth therefore a Reſt to the People of God, for he that is entred into his Reſt, he alſo hath ceaſed from his own Works, as God did from his; Let us labour therefore to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into that Reſt.</hi> This cauſeth old <hi>Simeon</hi> to cry out, <hi>Lord, now letteſt thou thy ſervant depart in peace.</hi> Finally, the Holy City is called <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> which ſignifies a <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Peace,</hi> And God himſelf makes this promiſe,

Wherefore if the Peace which God grants to believing Souls in this life, ſurpaſſeth all underſtanding, what may we judge ſhall be the full enjoyment of an Eternal Peace in the Kingdom of Heaven; the tongues of Men and Angels is not able to expreſs its Dignity and Excellency.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, becauſe Men are lovers of Pleaſures, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights, and Pomp, and that the moſt part ſeek for nothing, but how to drive away their ſorrows, and to recreate themſelves with paſtimes; Therefore the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licities of Paradiſe are repreſented by Rejoycings, Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, and Eternal Solemnities, as in the 36 <hi>Pſalm, Thou ſhalt cauſe them to drink of the River of thy pleaſure<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>All our ſenſes ſhall partake in theſe Heavenly and Everlaſting Pleaſures; our Eyes ſhall behold with tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports of joy, the ſacred countenance of our Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, the Riches and wonderful Beauty of his Palace, the Glory and Magnificence of his Empire; our Ears ſhall be delighted with the Muſick of the bleſſed Saints,
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:41646:250" rendition="simple:additions"/>and with the Tunes of the Angels, and of the Church Triumphant; our ſmelling ſhall receive the ſweet per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fumes of our Bridegroom, whoſe Garments are of Myrrh, and whoſe Vine, always bloſſoming, gives a good ſmell; our Palat ſhall taſte the Bread of Angels, the hidden Manna, the Fruits of the Tree of Life, the Waters iſſuing forth to everlaſting Life, and the new Wine of the Kingdom of Heaven. Our Hands ſhall em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the Saviour of the World, and with our Feet we ſhall walk about the ſtreets of that golden City, the Heavenly <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and we ſhall follow the Lamb whitherſoever he goeth, <hi>Revel.</hi> 14.</p>
            <p>Although I ſpeak to you in this manner, I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded <hi>Chriſtian Souls,</hi> that you underſtand very well that theſe expreſſions and ſuch like, are not to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood in a litteral Sence, and that they are but dark Shadows, and imperfect Images of the advantages of the life to come. You have not forgot what <hi>St. Paul</hi> ſaith, That they are things which Eye hath not ſeen, Ear hath not heard, and which never entred into the heart of Man, which God hath prepared for them that love him, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. And that this great God, whoſe Riches are inexhauſtible, doth in us abundantly, above what we are able to ask or think, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3. ſo that when you ſee before you all the moſt Beautiful, Amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, Glorious, and excellent things of the World; you may ſay in your ſelves, without doubt, the Glory and Happineſs of Heaven, is ſomething more than all this, for it is elevated ſo much above all Earthly enjoyments, and ſurpaſſeth, ſo much all the thoughts and conceits of Man, that it is not poſſible to deſcribe it in its own Colours, nor to fancy it really as it is.</p>
            <p>Think not therefore, <hi>Chriſtian Souls,</hi> to meet in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven with a Paradiſe, ſomething like to your Gardens, nor with Flowers, like to ſuch as adorn your pleaſant Walks and Fields, nor Fruits like to ſuch as hang up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your Trees; you may be aſſured, that God will diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:41646:251" rendition="simple:additions"/>things infinitely more pleaſant and delightful, and more laſting. Fancy not ſuch a City, built up as ours is, where Gold, Silver, Pealrs, and precious Stones are to be ſeen: you may expect ſomething more Noble and Magnificent, than all the richeſt and moſt ſtately Cities of the World; God will cauſe you to ſee, not only the beauty of Silver, the purity of Gold, the whiteneſs of Pearls, and the brightneſs of precious Stones; but you ſhall diſcover ſomething more beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful, purer, whiter, brighter, and ſomething more ſurprizing than any Earthly thing. Think not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any material Crown, or to aſcend up upon Thrones, like to thoſe of Kings and Princes, You may juſtly fancy ſomething more Glorious, and more laſting.</p>
            <p>I am alſo perſwaded, Chriſtians, that you expect not in Heaven, to find Tables covered, as thoſe of the rich Worldlings; nor to glutt your ſelves with a Feaſt, like that of the Nuptials of Earthly Princes, without doubt, your Faith hath an eye to ſomething more Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly and Glorious; Your Soul hungers for more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite Dainties, and is athirſt for more delicious and ſweeter Drinks. You are too well inſtructed, to think to live in Heaven an animal, and a ſenſual Life; Such a groſs conceit, becomes only the Impoſtor <hi>Mahomet,</hi> and his fond Paradiſe.</p>
            <p>In this life that we lead upon Earth, there are two things which chiefly diſcover our natural Infirmity; The firſt is our eating and drinking, abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to make up the breaches that labor, and the natural heat do make, which ſpend and feed upon the radical Humour, which ſerves to our life, as Oil to a Lamp. The other is Marriage, appointed by God for the continuance and propagation of the humane Race. But in Heaven our life ſhall be altogether Angelical, Spiritual, and Supernatural; our Bodies ſhall be no more ſubject to corruption, nor to any alteration, they ſhall want no more food than the Stars do at
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:41646:251" rendition="simple:additions"/>preſent, and the reſt of the Celeſtial Bodies; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Holy Ghoſt ſpeaks expreſly, That we ſhall neither hunger nor thirſt, that the Sun ſhall not burn, nor any other heat trouble us. That is to ſay, as we ſhall never be inclinable to eat or drink, the moſt burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heat, and the moſt furious Flames ſhall have no power to hurt our Bodies, when they ſhall have caſt off all ſenſual and earthly qualities, and inſtead of them it ſhall be clothed with Light and Glory; therefore at that time there ſhall be no need of propogating the Species, or of multiplying the Perſons by Marriage, for we ſhall not be then ſubject to earthly Paſſions, and the number of the Elect ſhall be compleat; the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation of Saints ſhall be full, and the building of the Church ſhall be perfectly made up; therefore our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt aſſures us, That in the Kingdom of Heaven they ſhall neither take nor give in Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, but that we ſhall be like the Angels of God, we ſhall enjoy the light of their underſtanding, the Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their Wills, and the Purity of their affections.</p>
            <p>When the Queen of <hi>Sheba</hi> ſaw the Glory and State of King <hi>Solomon,</hi> and heard all his excellent Diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, ſhe was extraordinarily ſurprized and wondred; therefore ſhe told this great Prince, <hi>It was a true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port that I heard in mine own Land, of thy Acts, and of thy Wiſdom; howbeit, I believed not the words, until I came, and mine eyes had ſeen it; and behold, the halfe was not told me, thy Wiſdom and proſperity exceedeth the ſame which I heard; happy are thy Men, happy are theſe thy ſervants which ſtand continually before thee, and that hear thy Wiſdom. I am perſwaded, Believing Souls,</hi> that ſomething like to this ſhall happen to us, when we ſhall be come to the Heavenly <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> to behold our Lord Jeſus Chriſt himſelf, of whom <hi>Solomon</hi> was but a Type, and a Figure, for he had but a ſpark of his Glory, and but a beam of his Wiſdom; when we ſhall ſee this peaceable King Crowned with an Heavenly
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:41646:252" rendition="simple:additions"/>Rainbow, we ſhall be raviſh'd into admiration, and as it were, tranſported out of our ſelves; then we ſhall ſpeak in this manner to his Divine Majeſty: O Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Monarch, all that I have ever heard or imagined of thy Wiſdom, of thy Glory, Riches, Beauty, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Pleaſure of thy Paradiſe, is more than true, but it is not the thouſand part of that which I ſee this day. O bleſſed are they that dwell in thy Houſe, and that praiſe thee without ceaſing; happy are they that behold thy Glorious Face, and hear thy Divine Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. After that, the Queen of <hi>Sheba</hi> had been ſome time in the Court of King <hi>Solomon,</hi> ſhe returned back to her own home; but when we ſhall be once en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into the Glory and Happineſs of Paradiſe, we ſhall never depart out again; we ſhall behold continually this Glorious King of Kings, and we ſhall hear, with Divine tranſports of Joy, the wonderful expreſſions of his Wiſdom; we ſhall not only be with him for ever and ever, but we ſhall always be in him, and he in us.</p>
            <p>To take off your mind from all carnal and world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Thoughts, the Glory and Happineſs of Paradiſe, is repreſented unto us by the Light, as in the 12 <hi>Chapter</hi> of the <hi>Revelations,</hi> of the Prophet <hi>Daniel, They that be wiſe ſhall ſhine as the brightneſs of the Firmament, and they that turn many to Righteouſneſs, as the Stars for ever and ever.</hi> And in the 13 of <hi>St. Matth.</hi> our Saviour ſaith expreſly, <hi>That the Righteous ſhall ſhine as the Sun, in the Kingdom of his Father.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Finally, it is promiſed, as the higheſt Glory and Happineſs, that we ſhall ſtand before the Throne of God, that we ſhall ſit with Jeſus Chriſt upon his Throne, and that we ſhall ſee his Face. <hi>St. John</hi> in the 22 of the <hi>Revel.</hi> ſpeaks in this manner, in the deſcription of the Heavenly <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> he ſaith, that the Throne of God, and of the Lamb, are in it, that his ſervants ſhall ſerve him, and ſee his Face, and that his Name ſhall be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:41646:252" rendition="simple:additions"/>their Forehead. When we look to behold the Sun, our Faces become not more radiant nor Glorious; nay many times our Eyes thereby dazle, and our Skin be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes blacker, and more ſwarthy; but when we ſhall look upon God in his Love and Glory, we ſhall be perfectly enlightened, and become brighter, and more ſhining; This appears by <hi>Moſes</hi>'s perſon, when he came down from the Holy Mountain, his Face was full of Beams of Light, ſo that the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> could not endure to look ſtedfaſt upon him. If therefore this faithful Servant of God had ſuch a bright coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, by his continuance with God, upon an Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Mountain, during the ſpace of forty days and forty nights, and by a ſight of ſome light expreſſions of his Glory; what will be, think ye, your Light, and the brightneſs of your Countenance, when you ſhall be raiſed above the Heavens, to continue with God, and to behold his Face thouſands and thouſands of Ages; and at the end of all that time, it ſhall be but the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of that moſt bleſſed contemplation, which ſhall never end?</p>
            <p>When we caſt our Eyes upon a beautiful Perſon, we become neither more beautiful nor happier; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but an unprofitable <hi>Idea</hi> remains in our fancy, and many times that alſo quickly vaniſheth away; but when we ſhall look upon God we ſhall become like him, and in this likeneſs, we ſhall find fullneſs of Joy, of Happineſs, and Glory; This is promiſed to us by the Royal Prophet, in the 16 <hi>Pſalm, In thy Preſence, O God! is fulneſs of joy, and at thy right Hand there are Pleaſures for evermore,</hi> And in the 17 <hi>Pſalm, As for me, I will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold thy face in Righteouſneſs, I ſhall be ſatisfied when I awake with thy likeneſs.</hi> And the beloved Diſciple, of the beloved of the Father, whoſe Writings are full of love, confirms this Truth, <hi>Beloved,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>Now we are the Sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we ſhall be, but
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:41646:253" rendition="simple:additions"/>we know, that when he ſhall appear, we ſhall be like him, for we ſhall ſee him as he is.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You ſee therefore, <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> unto what extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Glory and Happineſs, you have right to pretend, for in Heaven, God ſhall not only make us ſhine as the Sun and the Stars; he ſhall not only cloath us with the brightneſs of the glorified Saints and Angels, but he promiſeth a great deal more, to make us like unto himſelf; He ſhall not only ſatisfy us with the fatneſs of his Houſe, and cauſe us to drink of the Rivers of his Pleaſures; he ſhall not only fill us with his Treaſures, enlighten us with his brightneſs, cloath us with his Honors, and crown us with his Glory; but he himſelf will become our Meat and our Drink, our Treaſure, our Sun, and Glory; and if I may ſo ſay, to ſatisfy us, and accompliſh our Happineſs, God ſhall, as it were, diſſolve himſelf into Rivers and Seas of Divine and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable Pleaſures; but that I may not be miſunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood in ſuch bold and figurative Language, it ſhall ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice me to ſay with <hi>St. Paul, That God will be in us all in all;</hi> that is to ſay, that he will dwell, and make his abode in us, in reſpect of his Being, and that he will cauſe us to feel in us his Glorious preſence as much as a finite and limited Nature, as ours, is capable of. What the Jews have invented, of the Manna which their Fathers did feed upon in the Wilderneſs, may juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be appropriated to Almighty God, as he intends to reveal himſelf unto us in Heaven; for there is no taſte but ſhall be ſatisfied, no deſire but ſhall be filled. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, God ſhall be our Meat and our Drink, our Light, alſo our Cloathing; and all that we can imagine in him, and his Divine Enjoyment; we ſhall find beyond all that we can think or deſire. The knowledge of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual and Celeſtial things, which we attain to here below, is like the breaking of the day; and that we ſhall enjoy hereafter, ſhall be like that of the Sun, when it ſhines in our Meridian. But to ſpeak in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:41646:253" rendition="simple:additions"/>Language, <hi>Now we know in part, and we prophecy in part, but when that which is perfect, ſhall come, then that which is in part, ſhall be done away, for now we ſee through a Glaſs darkly, but then we ſhall ſee him face to face;</hi> whilſt we continue in this life, God diſcovers to us only the borders of his Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, we cannot underſtand much of it, but in the life to come, he ſhall reveal to us the depths of his Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Myſteries, into which the Angels themſelves de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to pry. In our underſtanſtings, God ſhall be as a Sun to enlighten them for ever and ever, and ſcatter away all Miſts of Errors, and Miſtakes. At preſent, our Will hath its imperfections, and oft-times it rebels a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God, but then it ſhall be perfectly ſanctified and reformed, according to the Image of God. It ſhall burn with an Holy Zeal, and with a Love for him. It ſhall deſire nothing but his Glory, and a conformity to his Holy Will. It ſhall not only obey God without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, but it ſhall fly with an Holy earneſtneſs and ſpeed, to the performance of his Sacred Commands. Whilſt we remain in the Fetters of this crazy and ſinful fleſh, there is always ſome filth and diſorder in our affections, but when we ſhall come to this Eſtate of Glory, God will ſanctify them in ſuch a manner, by his Preſence, that they ſhall be purer and cleaner, than the Stars, or the Sun-beams; they ſhall become Celeſtial Fires, and Divine Flames, proceeding from God's love to us. In a word, that Being of Beings, who is Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it ſelf, that Author and Origin of all Beauty, that Object ſo exceeding Glorious and Lovely, ſhall raviſh us in ſuch a manner, that our underſtandings ſhall be continually employed in beholding him, our Wills and Affections in loving and embracing him, and all the faculties of our Souls, ſhall labour to be united to him, and to be like him. It ſhall be in this manner, that we ſhall be made partakers of the Divine Nature; for we muſt not fancy that we ſhall be made partakers of
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:41646:254" rendition="simple:additions"/>God's infinite Being, for this Divine Eſſence, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diviſible, and uncommunicable to the Creatures, ſo that none but God can enjoy it, but God's Holineſs ſhall imprint in our Souls its Bleſſed and Glorious Image; and that of all his wonderful Vertues, when God ſhall ſhew himſelf to us as he is, he will cauſe us to become like him, by producing in us an impreſſion of his Divine countenance.</p>
            <p>It may be you will inquire of me, whether we ſhall ſee God, and how we ſhall behold him? This queſtion is too conſiderable to be paſſed over lightly. I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> that you will not be diſpleaſed, not only to hear my judgement, but that of the Holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, from whence we draw all our inſtructions, as out of a Fountain. Some imagine, that God cannot be ſeen, neither in this life, nor in the life to come. Their reaſons are very ſtrong and weighty? for firſt, God is of an inviſible Nature: This Quality is aſcribed to him by the Sacred writers, as in the 11 of the <hi>Heb.</hi> The Apoſtle ſaith, that <hi>Moſes</hi> by Faith ſaw him, who is inviſible, and in the 1 Epiſtle to <hi>Timothy,</hi> in the 1 Chapter he ſaith, To the King Eternal, Immortal, Inviſible, the only wiſe God, be Honor and Glory for ever and ever, <hi>Amen.</hi> Secondly, we read in the 33 of <hi>Exod.</hi> when <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaid to God, <hi>I pray thee let me ſee thy Glory;</hi> God anſwered him, thou canſt not ſee my Face, for no man ſhall ever ſee my Face, and live. Thirdly, <hi>St. John</hi> in the 1 Chapter of his Goſpel ſpeaketh thus, <hi>No Man hath ſeen God at any time, the only begotten Son, which is in the boſom of the Father, he hath declared him.</hi> Laſtly, <hi>St. Paul</hi> ſeems to remove all doubt, for he ſaith, not only, <hi>that God alone hath im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality, that he dwells in a Light unto which no man can approach, and that no man hath ever ſeen him; but he ſaith more, that no man can ſee him,</hi> 1 Tim. 6.</p>
            <p>Others are of a contrary opinion, That God may be ſeen in this life, but that in the life to come, he ſhall
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:41646:254" rendition="simple:additions"/>be ſeen more perfectly; that which encourageth this opinion is, that God hath put into the Hearts of all his Children, an earneſt deſire of ſeeing his Face, and that in this contemplation they place their greateſt Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs and Glory. This was <hi>David</hi>'s deſire, A man af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter God's own heart, in the fourth <hi>Pſalm, There be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that ſay, who will ſhew us any good. Lord lift thou up the light of thy countenance upon us.</hi> And in the 42 Pſalm, <hi>My Soul thirſteth for God, for the living God, when ſhall I come and appear before God.</hi> This is the deſire alſo of the Prophet <hi>Aſaph</hi> in the 80 <hi>Pſalm,</hi> O God of Hoſts, cauſe thy Face to ſhine, and we ſhall be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. Secondly, we have heard <hi>David</hi> ſay, I ſhall ſee thy face in Righteouſneſs, I ſhall be ſatisfied when I awake, with thy likeneſs, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 17. And <hi>St. Paul</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth that we ſhall ſee God face to face. And <hi>St. John</hi> aſſures us, <hi>That we ſhall ſee God as he is.</hi> Thirdly, in the 3 Chapter of <hi>Numbers,</hi> God ſpeaks in this manner to <hi>Aaron</hi> and <hi>Miriam,</hi> who had murmured againſt their Brother <hi>Moſes, If there be a Prophet among you, I the Lord will make my ſelf known unto him in a viſion, and will ſpeak unto him in a dream, my ſervant</hi> Moſes <hi>is not ſo, who is faithful in all mine Houſe, with him will I ſpeak mouth to mouth, even apparently, and not in dark ſpeeches, and the ſimilitude of the Lord ſhall he behold.</hi> Laſtly, we have heard the voice from Heaven, that repreſents to me the bleſſed Eſtate of the Glorified, ſaying, <hi>That they ſhall ſee the face of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If it be lawful for me to ingage my ſelf in ſuch an high Meditation, which is above the capacity of Men and Angels; I ſhould declare to you in few words, how it may be ſaid that we ſhall ſee God, and in what manner it is impoſſible to behold him. But firſt we muſt take notice of two or three diſtinctions, which if we underſtand well, we ſhall find no more difficulty in this queſtion.</p>
            <pb n="452" facs="tcp:41646:255" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p>Firſt, God may be conſidered in three ſeveral re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, as he is in Himſelf, and in his proper Being. It is in this reſpect, that our Souls do earneſtly long for h m, and deſire to draw near to him, and be united unto him, as to their Soveraign Good, and the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomleſs Fountain of Glory and Happineſs. Secondly, as he doth reveal and diſcover himſelf on Earth, by certain Images, and Tokens of his favourable Preſence. Thirdly, as he ſhall manifeſt himſelf in Heaven by the Glorious Images, and Divine marks of his Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Preſence.</p>
            <p>Secondly, we muſt diſtinguiſh the ſeveral kinds of ſight, for there is the ſight of the Body, which looks only upon the objects, whereof the Images and Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies are within the reach and capacity of our Eye-ſight, as are Colour and Light. There is the ſight of the underſtanding which ſees and beholds the things that are at a diſtance from our ſences, as the ſpiritual and inviſible ſubſtances, and the Eſſential forms of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. There is alſo the ſight of Faith which riſeth, yet ſomething higher than our underſtanding, as it is du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring our abode here below; when it is enlightened with God's Divine Grace; it ſees and beholds things which the eye of the Body never ſaw, and the ſenſual under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings of Men, can never comprehend; as the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries of Chriſtian Religion and the powers of the World to come.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, we muſt diſtinguiſh the knowledge of the Underſtanding, for ſometimes it is obſcure and confuſed; at other times it is plain and diſtinct: Moreover, that knowledge which is moſt certain; and the plaineſt, is of two ſorts, the one hath bounds and limits, ſuitable to its ſubject, that is to ſay, ſuitable to the ability and reach of the Underſtanding; the other is abſolute, and of the ſame nature, as its object, that is to ſay, as the thing it ſelf, which the underſtanding looks upon and beholds.</p>
            <pb n="453" facs="tcp:41646:255" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p>God, as he is in himſelf, and in his own Eſſence and Being, hath never been ſeen by the Eye of the Body, and ſhall never be, neither in this life, nor in the life to come; for God is a Spirit, and of an inviſible Nature, 1 <hi>Timothy</hi> 6. In this reſpect <hi>St. Paul</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms, <hi>That God dwels in a Light which no man can ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach unto, that no man hath ever ſeen him, nor can ſee him,</hi> John 3. But this good God, who of himſelf is invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, delights to ſhew him ſelf to his Creatures, in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ways.</p>
            <p>Firſt, God ſhews himſelf unto all Men, in the works of the Creation of the great World, for as <hi>St. Paul</hi> ſaith in the 1 of the <hi>Romans, The inviſible things of God from the creation of the World, are clearly ſeen, being under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by the things that are made even his Eternal Power and Godhead;</hi> Eſpecially, he hath been pleaſed to give in the <hi>Light,</hi> a production of Nature, and the firſt of all viſible Creatures, a lively Image of himſelf, for as there is nothing more ample, purer, and more beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful than the Light; Likewiſe, there is no viſible Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that repreſents ſo well, this great God, who is a Being moſt pure, moſt beautiful and perfect, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Lights, and the true Sun of our Souls.</p>
            <p>Secondly, God diſcovers himſelf in all the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of his wonderful Providence, and chiefly, in his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary and miraculous Operations; for when men perceive productions, which exceed all the ordinary ſtrength of Nature, they are forced to acknowledge, that they come immediately from an infinite Power. As <hi>Pharaoh's</hi> Magicians, for when they ſaw, that by their Magick Art, they were not able to counterfeit <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Miracle, they confeſſed, <hi>That it was the finger of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, God diſcovers himſelf in his Holy and Divine Word, which is to us as a beautiful and perfect Look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-Glaſs, where we may ſee his Image, and the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Glory; This was <hi>St. Pauls</hi> judgement, when
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:41646:256" rendition="simple:additions"/>he ſaith, <hi>That all, we that behold as in a Glaſs, the glory of the Lord, with open face, are changed into the ſame Image, from Glory to Glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord.</hi> 2 Cor. 3.18.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, God revealed himſelf to the Church of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> in the Ark, the Signe and ordinary Token of his Gracious Preſence. He did ſpeak unto this People from the midſt of the two Golden Cherubims, and did pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh his Divine Oracles; there he was pleaſed to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver himſelf in divers repreſentations, chiefly in the Cloud and Fire which came down from Heaven. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Signe, bearing the name of the thing ſignified, is ſometimes ſtiled <hi>The Lord;</hi> as in that paſſage where <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>My Soul is athirſt for God, for the mighty and living God; O when ſhall I go and appear in the preſence of God?</hi> Pſal. 42.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, God manifeſted himſelf to the Patriarchs and Prophets, in Dreams and Viſions, by Divine Raptures, and Prophetical Elevations. In this manner he appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Patriarch <hi>Jacob</hi> in <hi>Bethel,</hi> for when it is ſaid, that God was at the end of the myſtical Ladder, which reach'd up to Heaven, without doubt, he gave ſome Sign and Teſtimony there of his Preſence. And when the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> mentions his Glorious Throne, he makes no difficulty to ſay, <hi>I ſaw the Lord ſitting upon a Throne, high, and lifted up, and his Train filled the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; above it ſtood the Seraphims, each one had ſix wings, with two he covered his Face, and with two he covered his Feet, and with two he did fly; and one cried to another, and ſaid, Holy, Holy, Holy is the Lord of Hoſts, the whole Earth is full of his Glory, and the poſts of the door moved at the voice of him that cried, and the Houſe was filled with ſmoak,</hi> Iſai. 6. And the Prophet <hi>Micah,</hi> when he ſpeaks of his Viſion he ſaith, <hi>I have ſeen the Lord ſitting upon his Throne, and all the Hoſts of Heaven ſtanding at his right hand, and at his left,</hi> 1 King 12. And the Prophet <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel</hi> deſcribing one of his viſions, ſpeaks in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:41646:256" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>I beheld, till the Thrones were caſt down, and the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient of days did ſit, whoſe Garment was white as Snow, and the hair of his Head like the pure Wooll, his Throne was like the fiery flame, and his wheels as hurning fire, a fiery ſtream iſſued, and came forth from before him, thouſand thouſands miniſtred unto him, and ten thouſand times ten thouſand ſtood before him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sixthly, God ſhewed himſelf unto <hi>Moſes,</hi> in a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular manner, not only when he appeared unto him in <hi>Horeb,</hi> and ſpoke to him out of the flaming Buſh, but eſpecially when God appeared unto him in the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Mountain, and, for the ſpace of forty days and forty nights, diſcourſed with him familiarly, as with a friend; for at that time, he expoſed before him, ſuch Glorious and Magnificent Tokens of his Divine Preſence, that it was almoſt the ſame thing, as if he had ſeen God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. God gave him more Light and Knowledge of his Glory, than to any other of his Prophets, and revealed himſelf unto him in a more familiar manner, than to any other living Man; Becauſe of theſe glorious and extraordinary appearances of God's preſence, and of the brightneſs of his Light, which ſhined ſo clear in the Soul of <hi>Moſes,</hi> becauſe of that Holy familiarity which he had with God, that he ſpeaks of it in ſuch a manner, in the 12 Chapter of the Book of <hi>Numbers;</hi> for we cannot underſtand that place in a litteral ſence; That <hi>Moſes</hi> did really ſee God himſelf, and that with the Eyes of the Body, he beheld his Being, which is altogether inviſible: But we muſt underſtand it in this manner, that never any man beheld ſuch glorious expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the Godhead, with the Eyes of the Body. That never any Man diſcourſed ſo familiarly with God as <hi>Moſes;</hi> never any man<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> hath ever had ſo clear and plain a knowledge of his great Glory, and Divine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, God hath often appeared unto Men in Humane ſhapes, and hath given them ſuch viſible ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:41646:257" rendition="simple:additions"/>of his Holy Preſence, that ſuch as have ſeen thoſe Images, tell us that they have ſeen God. It is in this manner that <hi>Jacob</hi> ſpeaks, when he had wreſtled with God in his Body; when he was moved, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by an aſſiſting Angel, but alſo by God himſelf, who diſcovers there his Divine Vertue, <hi>I have ſeen,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>God face to face, and my ſoul hath been ſaved,</hi> Gen. 32. <hi>Manoah,</hi> the Father of <hi>Sampſon,</hi> tells aſmuch when he had ſeen the Humane ſhape, in which God was pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to appear, when he aſcended up into Heaven, in the flame of his ſacrifice, <hi>For certain we ſhall dye, for we have ſeen God,</hi> Judg. 13. In like manner, when God appeared to <hi>Abraham,</hi> in the ſhape of a man, this man is called the Lord, and <hi>Abraham</hi> bowed himſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, and worſhiped; and at one time this Holy Patriarch ſaw no leſs than three Humane ſhapes which appeared to him at once. Some think that God appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed but in one of theſe ſhapes, and that the two others were Angels. That which confirms this opinion is, that of theſe three perſons, there is but one that ſpeaks as God, and receives <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Adoration; And when he appears no more, the two others are ſtiled Angels, in the beginning of the 19 Chapter. But others believe with ſome antient Doctors of the Church, that theſe, three Humane ſhapes were a true Image, and living Repreſentation of the moſt Holy, moſt Glorious, and moſt Wonderful Trinity. In this opinion, there is nothing contrary to the Analogy of Faith.</p>
            <p>Finally, God hath diſcovered himſelf by his Son in a particular manner, he is named therefore; <hi>The Image of God, the Image of the inviſible God, and God mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted in fleſh.</hi> God hath not only imprinted in him, ſome tokens of his Godhead, and Marks of his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Power, he cauſed him not to walk and move as the borrowed Bodies of the old Teſtament. He hath not only ingraven in him, the perfect Image of all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Divine Vertues; God is not in him in a ſhadow or
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:41646:257" rendition="simple:additions"/>Figure, as he was in the Ark, and in <hi>Solomons</hi> Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; but he hath dwelt in him bodily, and by his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Godhead, as <hi>St. Paul</hi> informs us, <hi>That in him dwelleth Bodily,</hi> that is to ſay, Really, and Eſſentially, all the fulneſs of the Godhead; therefore our Saviour tells <hi>St. Philip, That he that hath ſeen him, hath ſeen the Father,</hi> John 14.</p>
            <p>This being thus, let us now conſider how we ſee God, now here below, and how we ſhall ſee him hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in Heaven: At preſent we ſee him with the eyes of the Body in his viſible Works; And we ſee his Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alſo with the Eye of our Underſtanding, but in a weak and a languiſhing manner; we know him with a very obſcure and imperfect Knowledge, for this cauſe <hi>St. Paul</hi> ſaith very well and truly, <hi>That we know in part, and we prophecy in part.</hi> We ſee God alſo with the Eye of Faith, it is with this Eye that we ſee him, as <hi>Moſes</hi> did, who is inviſible, and that we behold our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, ſitting at the right hand of God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, above all Principalities and Powers, worſhiped and adored by all the glorified Church in Heaven. In Paradiſe we hope to ſee with the Eyes of our glorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Body; the Images and Marks of the Divinity, ſo Glorious, and Magnificent, ſo Beautiful and full of Majeſty, that in compariſon of that, whatſoever ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to the Prophets and Patriarchs in their illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious Viſions, was nothing but obſcurity and dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. And with the ſame Eyes of the Body we ſhall ſee God in the Perſon of our glorified Saviour, who is the brightneſs of his Glory, and the expreſs Image of his Perſon, ſo that we may well ſay with <hi>Job,</hi> in a full aſſurance of Faith, <hi>I know that my Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er liveth, and that he ſhall ſtand at the latter day, upon the earth, and though after my Skin, Worms deſtroy this Body, I ſhall ſee God in my Fleſh, whom I ſhall ſee for my ſelf, and my Eyes ſhall be hold, and not another,</hi> Job 19. But for the Eſſence and Being of God, and for the
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:41646:258" rendition="simple:additions"/>Eternal Godhead, we ſhall not, nor cannot ſee it with the Eyes of the Body; Let them become ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo Glorious, Incorruptible, and Immortal. We ſhall neither ſee it with the eye of Faith, for then Faith ſhall be totally aboliſhed, and we ſhall not walk any more by Faith, but by ſight, but we ſhall ſee God with the Eye of the Underſtanding, enlightened with a Divine Glory. Now as we have taken notice there are two ſorts of Contemplations and Knowledges, the one perfect, proportioned to the object, which we behold and look upon, the other imperfect, ſuitable to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, beholding, and to the abilities of the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Our future knowledge of God, ſhall not be of the firſt, but of the latter ſort; that is to ſay, That we ſhall never ſee into the bottom of the Myſteries of God's Divine Majeſty, and of his Glory. We ſhall never know perfectly, this higheſt Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, this infinite Being, this Incomprehenſible and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Godhead; for things are in their Actions, as they are in their Beings and Abilities. Now in the moſt glorious State of Heaven, our Beings and Abilities ſhall be limited, and circumſcribed; therefore it ſhall be abſolutely impoſſible for us to comprehend perfectly the Being of God, who is infinite in it ſelf, and in all its wonderful perfections. The Holy Angels them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, the Cherubims and Seraphims; theſe Beings of Light and Glory, are not able to pry into theſe bottomleſs depths, they are not able to approach this infinite Light. In a word, it is neceſſary to be God himſelf, to comprehend and underſtand perfectly, the infinite Glory, and the higheſt perfections of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head.</p>
            <p>Although our ſight ſhall not be able to ſearch into the bottom of theſe depths of the Divinity, although we ſhall never be able to comprehend perfectly the infinite Being of God; nevertheleſs we hope to behold openly, this wonderful object, and to obtain
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:41646:258" rendition="simple:additions"/>as much knowledge of it, as ſhall be requiſite to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der us perfectly happy; for as when our Eye beholds the Noon-Sun, it cannot ſtedfaſtly look upon it, nor receive all its beams, but it partakes of as much as is neceſſary to enlighten it; and when there ſhould be a thouſand Suns, our Eyes would never make uſe of more Light then they do at preſent Likewiſe, in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding the Father of Lights, this beautiful Sun of our Souls, it is altogether impoſſible to receive the immenſity of its Beams; but we ſhall partake of as much as ſhall be neceſſary to drive away all our dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and to fill us full of a perfect Light, to make us become Light in the Lord, and to cauſe us to ſhine for ever, as ſo many Stars and little Suns. As an emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Veſſel, when it is caſt into the Sea, comprehends not all its Waters, but receives only enough to fill it up, ſo that there is no part empty. Likewiſe when we ſhall be caſt into the Ocean of the Godhead; we ſhall not be able to comprehend and receive God's infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Glory and Happineſs, but we ſhall receive and comprehend as much as ſhall content all our deſires, and ſatisfy all our craving Appetites, ſo that there ſhall be nothing at all wanting in us, which might be expected in the higheſt felicity of an humane Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
            <p>I do not ſay, in the higheſt Felicity, abſolutely with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out limitation, for there are two kinds of Felicities, the one abſolutely perfect, beyond which there can be nothing expected. This Felicity or Happineſs is only to be found in God; the other is perfect, in a certain degree. As the perfect happineſs of the Angels <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> to attain to that degree of Glory, of which the Angeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Nature is capable. Likewiſe, the perfect happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Man, is to enjoy all that Bleſſedneſs, whereof the Humane Nature alone and ſingle, is able to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy; I muſt ſay the ſingle Nature of Man, to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh it from that which is united to the Perſon of
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:41646:259" rendition="simple:additions"/>the Eternal Son of God; for by this means, this hath attained to an uncommunicable Glory, of which other Creatures cannot partake in the ſame perfection; it hath attained to an happineſs, far above the Glory of all the Children of God, and of all the Holy An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels of Heaven, far above what they can or may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect.</p>
            <p>Moreover, I may ſay, that there is a ſupreme and perfect Happineſs independant, which ſubſiſts of its ſelf, without any forreign aſſiſtance; this kind of hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs is only to be found in God. For as he is of himſelf an infinite Being, which borrows nothing from others. Likewiſe of himſelf he is abſolutely and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly happy. The other happineſs is that which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds not of our ſelves, but is derived to us from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; ſuch is the Glory and Happineſs of the Angels. This Leſſon the Holy Ghoſt teacheth us in theſe words, <hi>God puts Light into his Angels;</hi> that is to ſay, that theſe Holy Spirits have nothing of Light or Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, but it is derived to them from the Father of Lights, and his gracious Aſpect: ſuch alſo is the Glory of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, as Mediator; therefore he ſpeaks thus to God his Father, <hi>Glorify thy Son, that thy Son may Glorify thee,</hi> John 17. In a word, ſuch ſhall be our Glory and Happineſs, for as we have our Being from God, it is from him that we derive our Well-being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo; and it is from him that we expect all our Glory and Bliſs.</p>
            <p>From hence you may eaſily conclude, that God is the only object, and the only ſource of our Eternal Glo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>, and future Happineſs. If you enquire from me what ſhall be the Eſſential form? I anſwer, that it ſhall be our Likeneſs and Reſemblance with God, which ſhall be as perfect as an Humane Creature is capable of. Now this Reſemblance and Similitude ſhall conſiſt in three things, in a pure and bright Light, which ſhall not be mixed with the leaſt Darkneſs, in a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:41646:259" rendition="simple:additions"/>and a compleat Holineſs, where there ſhall not be the leaſt blemiſh, and in an infinite and unalterable joy and content, where there ſhall never be the leaſt cloud of Grief, but of this we have ſufficiently Treated already.</p>
            <p>Some there are that inquire whether in Paradiſe there ſhall be an equality, or an inequality of Glories and Happineſſes; to ſay the truth, this queſtion is more curious than neceſſary; for we need not inquire whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there ſhall be any more or leſs happy, than our ſelves. It ſhould ſuffice us for our comfort, to know, that if we be true Believers and truly penitent; if we fear God, as we ought to do, if we ſerve him with a Religious mind, until the laſt gasp, that in ſuch a caſe we ſhall attain to the Glory of the Children of God, and poſſeſs with them, a perfect and Eternal Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs. Nevertheleſs, that we may ſeem to omit no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, which might give ſatisfaction to every believing Soul; I ſhall examine this particular, but it ſhall be without advancing any new thing, which I have not ſeen in the Holy Goſpel, nor learn'd from the true Doctor of our Souls; I ſhall declare the opinion of the moſt Learned, upon this rich and excellent ſubject; afterwards, I ſhall add mine own, which I ſhall ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, as the reſt of this Treatiſe, to the judgement of the Wiſer and more Learned Perſons, who are better acquainted than I am, with the Spiritual and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Enjoyments.</p>
            <p>Some believe, that in Paradiſe there ſhall be every where, the ſame Glory and Happineſs, equal and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form in every individual Perſon. This opinion they back with theſe reaſons; Firſt, that we ſhall have no Glory nor Happineſs, but that which hath been pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed for us by the Death and Paſſion of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt; and that as this Glorious Saviour hath purchaſed this Glory and Happineſs, for all the Elect equally, they ſhall all enjoy it in the higheſt degree, and
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:41646:260" rendition="simple:additions"/>perfection. Secondly, that the Holineſs of all the Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſhall be perfect, therefore as they ſhall be all perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Holy, they ſhall be all likewiſe perfectly happy in the ſame degree. Thirdly, that our Saviour ſaith ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly, without any exception, <hi>That the Saints ſhall ſhine as the Sun in the Kingdom of their Father,</hi> Matth. 23. Now the Sun is the King of the Stars, and the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of all the Heavenly Bodies. Fourthly, That the Elect are repreſented in Heaven, as ſo many Kings, having upon their Heads, Crowns of Gold, <hi>Revel.</hi> 1.4, 5. Now there is no inequality between Kings, for each of them is in poſſeſſion of Soveraignty, and an inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendant and Supream Authority. Fifthly, That Jeſus Chriſt repreſents to us, the laſt tranſactions and paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the World, by the parable of a Father of a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, who at the end of the day, beſtows the ſame Salary, upon every one that hath laboured in his Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard, <hi>Matth.</hi> 20. Sixthly, That it is ſaid in general terms, <hi>That we ſhall ſee God face to face, and that we ſhall ſee him as he is,</hi> 1 Cor, 13. 1 John 3. and that in this bleſſed Viſion ſhall conſiſt the chief Happineſs of Man. Laſtly, That after the Reſurrection, <hi>God ſhall be in us all in all;</hi> which expreſſion declares the higheſt, and moſt compleat Happineſs and Glory.</p>
            <p>Others think the contrary, that in Heaven there ſhall be an inequality of Glory, and ſeveral degrees of Happineſs. This their opinion they ſtrengthen chiefly with two paſſages of Holy Scripture, the one is in the 14 of <hi>St. John,</hi> where Chriſt ſaith to his Apoſtles, <hi>In my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers houſe there are many Manſions.</hi> The other is in the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. where <hi>St. Paul</hi> diſcourſing at large, of the happineſs of the Saints after the Reſurrection, ſaith, <hi>There is one Glory of the Sun, another Glory of the Moon, and another Glory of the Stars, for one Star differeth from another in Glory, ſo is the reſurrection of the dead.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are ſome that are not content to believe an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equality of Glory and Happineſs, but they undertake
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:41646:260" rendition="simple:additions"/>further to diſcourſe of this matter, with as much bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as if God had admitted them to the knowledge of his Eternal Secrets, as if he had diſcovered to them all the wonders of the Heavenly <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> more plainly than to his beloved diſciple. Such tell us, not only, that there ſhall be divers degrees of Glory and Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but they inform, who they are that ſhall obtain ſuch and ſuch Degrees; they preſcribe in a Dogmatical and Magiſterial manner, which ſhall be the Glory of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins, which ſhall belong to Confeſſors, which ſhall be that of Martys. In a word, ſome are ſo much puffed up with an high conceit of themſelves, and of their own deſervings, that they make an open profeſſion of being of the number of ſuch as ſhall obtain the higheſt degrees of Glory and Happineſs.</p>
            <p>But my opinion is, that the Truth is to be found between theſe two extreams; I ſhall not impoſe any Law upon the Conſciences of any Man, in this particular, whereof the deciſion is not abſolutely neceſſary to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; yet we may ſay, that in Heaven there ſhall be divers degrees of Glory and Happineſs, but we dare not deſcribe them, nor venture to apply them to any perſons, or to tell, who of us ſhall poſſeſs ſuch and ſuch degrees. This were a bold attempt upon Heaven, and a taking of the forbidden Fruit; by ſuch an impudency we ſhould looſe our ſelves, inſtead of ſaving others, for ſuch as are ſo audacious as to ſearch into the Divine Majeſty, ſhall be ſwallowed up by his Glory. <hi>Prov.</hi> 25.</p>
            <p>And although we verily believe degrees of Glory, yet we may ſay, without offence to any perſon, that this belief is not to be eſtabliſhed upon the fore-mentioned paſſages, from whence we cannot gather any ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion; for in the 14 of <hi>St. John,</hi> our Saviour ſaith not, that there are divers Degrees, or divers Manſions, whereof ſome are Richer and more Glorious than others; but only, that in his Fathers Houſe there are many Manſions. The meaning of this Divine Saviour is as
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:41646:261" rendition="simple:additions"/>clear as the day, he had an intent to raiſe up the drooping courage of his Holy Apoſtles, and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort them in his abſence; for that purpoſe he aſſures them, that he is going to lodge in an Houſe, where there is not only room for himſelf, but alſo for them, and for all that ſhall believe in him, by their Teaching. He expounds his words plainly in the 17 Chapter of the ſame Goſpel, where he ſpeaks to God in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, <hi>Father, I will that they alſo whom thou haſt given me be with me where I am, that they may behold my Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry which thou haſt given me.</hi> For the other paſſage of the 1 of the <hi>Corinth.</hi> I beſeech you, devout Souls, read over the Apoſtles words, and conſider with a Religious ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, what goeth before, and what follows after; you ſhall find that the Apoſtle intends not to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the Saints, the one with the other, but only to diſcover the difference which is between our Bodies as they are in this corruptible and mortal life, and as they ſhall be when they ſhall have put on incorruption and immortality. Therefore, when he had ſaid, <hi>One is the Glory of the Sun, another is the Glory of the Moon, another the Glory of the Stars, for one Star differeth from another Star in Glory;</hi> He doth not add likewiſe, ſo ſhall be the Glory of one bleſſed Perſon, differing from another, but he ſaith, <hi>So ſhall be the reſurrection from the dead; The Body is ſown in corruption, it ſhall be raiſed in incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption; it is ſown in diſhonour, it it raiſed in glory; it is ſown in weakneſs, it is raiſed in power; it is ſown a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural body, it is raiſed a ſpiritual body.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From whence is it therefore that we gather theſe divers degrees of Glory and Happineſs? I anſwer, Firſt, from the divers and different pains and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the damned. For as in Hell there ſhall be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral degrees of Torments; Likewiſe, it is very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, that in Heaven, there ſhall be divers degrees of Happineſs, and ſeveral degrees of Glory. Secondly, God to declare his Divine Wiſdom, which is various in all
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:41646:261" rendition="simple:additions"/>things, beſtows at preſent all his Bleſſings and Riches with a wonderful variety, and with an admirable order. Thus you may ſee in nature, that God hath ſcattered up and down the World, divers gifts and excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies; for example the ſmell and beauty of Roſes, is different from that of the Lillies; the brightneſs of the Diamonds, is not like that of Rubies; the light of the Sun differs from that of the Moon and Stars. Likewiſe, it is very probable, that above all the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, there ſhall be divers degrees of Light and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Amongſt the Holy Angels, there are Titles of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, and ſeveral Dignities, therefore they are named <hi>Archangels, Thrones, Dominions, Principalities,</hi> and <hi>Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers:</hi> As therefore amongſt the Angels there are divers degrees of Glory; it is alſo likely that the ſame order ſhall be obſerved amongſt the Glorified in Heaven. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, as in the Church militant, the Graces of God differ very much. The Souls of the Faithful, are not the ſame in all reſpects, they have differing qualities and excellencies; there are in them divers degrees of Light, of Knowledge, of Faith, of Hope, of Charity, and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs. Likewiſe, according to the Analogy of Faith, there ſhould be alſo in the Church glorified, divers de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of Glory and Happineſs; and the rather, becauſe Glory is nothing elſe, but the compleating and perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Grace. This reaſon is ſo much the ſtronger, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in the parable of the Talents, Jeſus Chriſt gives to his ſervants a Glory, proportionable to the former Riches of his Grace. None can conceive, that the words relate to God's Favors, beſtowed upon his Children on Earth, for our Lord ſpeaks of that which he intends to do to them, when he ſhall come down from Heaven to judge the World. The words relate to the time, when he ſhall ſay to ſuch as have well employed the Talents of his Mercy, <hi>Well done good and faithful ſervant, enter into the joy of the Lord:</hi> They relate alſo to the time when he ſhall cauſe the unprofitable ſervant to <hi>be caſt
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:41646:262" rendition="simple:additions"/>into utter darkneſs, where there ſhall be weeping and gnaſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Teeth.</hi> It may alſo be worthy of our obſervation, that the felicities of Heaven are repreſented to us, by a Feaſt, where all partake of the ſame Meats, but ſome are ſeated in a more Honourable Room than others. This, as I conceive may be gathered from our Saviours words, <hi>Many ſhall come from the Eaſt and from the Weſt, and ſhall ſit at Table in the Kingdom of Heaven, with Abraham, Iſaac, and Jacob.</hi> It may alſo be gathered from that other paſſage where <hi>Lazarus</hi> is carried by the Holy An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels into <hi>Abraham's</hi> boſom. Laſtly, I ground my opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon the 12 Chapter of <hi>Daniel,</hi> where this bleſſed Prophet, when he had ſpoken in general terms, of the future Happineſs of the faithful, who ſhall riſe to Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life; he comes down to particularize ſome, unto whom God hath beſtowed more light upon Earth, and whoſe Miniſtry he hath made uſe of, to bring many Souls to Salvation, amongſt theſe, he ſeems to put many degrees of Glory, <hi>They that are wiſe ſhall ſhine as the brightneſs of the firmament, and they that bring many to righteouſneſs as the Stars, from ever and ever.</hi> From this paſſage one may apparently, conclude, that as the light of the Firmament, differs much from that of tha bright Stars; and as amongſt the Stars there is a diverſity and variety of Light: in the ſame manner there ſhall be divers and differing degrees of Glory, amongſt the glorified in Heaven.</p>
            <p>Now in anſwer to that reaſon, that Jeſus Chriſt hath purchaſed for us, the Glory and Happineſs of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; and that therefore this Glory and Happineſs ſhould be equal. I confeſs this reaſon is weighty, I intend not to refute it altogether, but I ſhall propoſe ſeveral things to the conſideration of the Pious and Devout Souls, that ſhall peruſe this Treatiſe. Firſt, that although the bloud of Jeſus Chriſt hath purchaſed for us Heaven; and that we are not able to deſerve it by our moſt rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate Actions, nor by our moſt grievous ſufferings
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:41646:262" rendition="simple:additions"/>and Martyrdom; becauſe that when we have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed all that is Commanded, our Saviour requires us to ſay, <hi>We be unprofitable ſervants, becauſe we have done but what we were bound to do,</hi> Luk 17. And becauſe his Holy Apoſtle aſſures us, that <hi>When all things are reckon'd up, the ſufferings of this preſent time, are not worthy to be compared with the glory which ſhall be reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in us,</hi> Rom. 8. Nevertheleſs, God is ſo Good, Merciful, and Bountiful, that he bears with our imperfections, that he rewards as a Father, with a free Reward, all the good Works of his fervants, eſpecially the works of Charity. Therefore Jeſus Chriſt tells his Apoſtles, and generally all the faithful; <hi>Whoſoever ſhall give unto you to drink a cup of water, becauſe you are Chriſts, verily I ſay unto you, he ſhall not looſe his reward.</hi> And becauſe 'tis the cuſtome of the Eaſtern People, to warm their drink; therefore to give a cup of cold water may be reckoned the ſmalleſt aſſiſtance. Our Saviour ſaith, <hi>Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever ſhall give unto one of theſe little ones, to drink a cup of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>old water only, in the name of a Diſciple, verily I ſay unto you, he ſhall not looſe his reward.</hi> Matth. 10. If ſuch as beſtow a cup of cold water for God's ſake, are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded in Heaven, what may not thoſe bountiful Souls expect there, who now ſpend their Eſtates in charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Deeds? <hi>He that ſoweth ſparingly ſhall reap ſparingly, he that ſoweth bountifully ſhall reap bountifully,</hi> 1 Cor. 9. Theſe be the words of <hi>St. Paul,</hi> which in my judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment declare plainly an inequality amongſt the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and Happineſſes which we are to reap in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. Beſides, we have heard a Prophet tell us, that all ſuch as, by the light of their Doctrines, and the Holineſs of their Lives, lead many Souls to their Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, ſhall ſhine for ever in Heaven, as ſo many bright Stars. It ſtands with reaſon, that if our Saviour will, in his infinite Mercy, reward ſuch a ſmall kindneſs as the gift of a draught of Water, to one of his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, they ſhall excell in Glory, who pour forth for
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:41646:263" rendition="simple:additions"/>his ſake in his quarrel, every drop of their Bloud, and by their deaths confirm his Holy Goſpel, <hi>This is a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſaying, If we dye with Jeſus Chriſt, we ſhall alſo live with him, if we ſuffer with him, we ſhall alſo reign with him.</hi> But that which ſeems to me yet ſtronger, which makes for this purpoſe, is, That all the ſpiritual Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which are beſtowed upon us in this life, proceed from the Holy Ghoſt, purchaſed for us by the Croſs of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and by his precious Bloud. Now theſe Graces are differing and various; if there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there are divers degrees in <hi>Grace,</hi> why ſhould not there be alſo divers degrees in <hi>Glory,</hi> ſeeing that both have been purchaſed for us with the ſame price; by the death and paſſion of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt?</p>
            <p>The other Argument drawn from the happineſs and perfection of the Glorified is rational, but not invincible, for ſeveral Diamonds may be perfect in their kind, ſo that the cleareſt Eye cannot take notice of any im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection; nevertheleſs, they may differ in weight and price. All the Stars have their perfection and light; Nevertheleſs, one Star differs from another Star in Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; All the Angels of Heaven are perfectly Happy and Holy, and yet there is a great inequality amongſt them in Glory and Dignity. Likewiſe, although all the Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſhall attain to a perfect Holineſs, in my judgement, that cannot hinder the diverſity of degrees of Glory and Happineſs.</p>
            <p>I acknowledge alſo, that the other objection, drawn out of theſe words, <hi>The Juſt ſhall ſhine as the Sun in the kingdom of their Father,</hi> is not to be deſpiſed, but it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes nothing to the purpoſe, for if you ſhould cut out excellently well, ſome Orbs of Chryſtal, of differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſizes, ſome greater, ſome leſs, and ſhould put them all in the Sun, they would be all full of Light in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry part; every one of them would repreſent the beautiful Image of that Sun that looks upon them, ſo that it may very well be ſaid of all of them, that they
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:41646:263" rendition="simple:additions"/>ſhine as the Sun. Nevertheleſs, according to their big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ſize, they receive more Light, and the Sun ſeems greater in the one than in the other. To the other ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, that all the Glorified in Heaven are named Kings. I anſwer, That this is not to be underſtood in a litteral Sence, no more then when it is ſaid, that they had on their Heads Crowns of Gold. That I may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in the ſame compariſon, I may ſay, that as all Kings have a Soveraign Majeſty, which acknowledges none above it, but God from whom it proceeds: Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs, ſome have a greater Power and Riches than others. Likewiſe all the glorified Saints ſhall enjoy a Soveraign, and perfect Happineſs, and receive it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately from God. This cannot hinder them from differing from one another in Glory. I anſwer, next to the other Argument, taken out of the Parable of the Father of the Family, who, at the evening of the day, rewarded equally all his Laborers, that had been employed in his Vineyard, giving to every one of them a penny, that Parables are as Pictures, in which, beſides the thing intended to be drawn, there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny particulars which ſerve but as flouriſhes to adorn the piece. If we ſhould conſider every paſſage of this Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, we might gather from hence, that amongſt ſuch as ſhall be ſaved, there ſhall be there ſome murmuring againſt God, who ſhall envy their companions, which is a groſs abſurdity to conceive; the deſigne of our Saviour is not to ſpeak of the equality of the glorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Saints, but his intent is to ſhew, that thoſe whom God calls firſt, ſhould not deſpiſe the others; becauſe God, who doth with his own what he pleaſeth, is able to make them equal, and to beſtow upon them the ſame advantages. Laſtly, as every one whom the good man of the Houſe ſent into his Vineyard at ſeveral times of the day, received for their Salary a penny; in the ſame manner, whomſoever God calls into his Church effectually, at any time, nay, at the hour of death,
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:41646:264" rendition="simple:additions"/>they ſhall receive from his infinite Bounty, eternal Life, but from hence we cannot conclude any thing, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to this Truth, that in Heaven there ſhall be divers degrees of Glory.</p>
            <p>The greateſt difficulty in my judgement is in this Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legation, <hi>That we ſhall ſee God face to face, and that he will be all in all</hi> 1 Cor. 13. 1 Cor. 15. Nevertheleſs, we may ſay, that as all the damned in Hell ſhall looſe all ſight of God, yet that cannot hinder the divers de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of Pain and Torment. Likewiſe all the glorified in Heaven ſhall ſee God; but this ſight which all ſhall enjoy, cannot remove the inequality of their Glory and Happineſs. As when all men look upon the ſame Sun, but ſeveral receive the benefit of its beams in a differing manner; thus we ſhall all behold the ſame God, but the Gracious Aſpect of his Countenance ſhall be caſt upon us variouſly, and produce in us divers and various effects. We may alſo make uſe of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther compariſon; As when we caſt many empty Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels into the ſame Sea, they are all filled up, ſo that it may be ſaid of them, that the Sea is in them all: ſome nevertheleſs, may be more capacious, and receive more Water than others. Likewiſe all the Saints ſhall enter into the ſame wonderful Ocean of the Godhead, they ſhall be all filled up to the brim with his Glorious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, ſo that God ſhall be all in all. Nevertheleſs, they ſhall receive differing meaſures of theſe Waters, iſſuing forth to Eternal life. In a word, as God ſhall caſt headlong all the Reprobates into the ſame Lake of Fire and Brimſtone, and yet there ſhall be divers degrees amongſt them, of puniſhments; ſo God ſhall cauſe all the Elect to drink out of the ſame River of Pleaſure; but there ſhall be a difference amongſt their degrees of Glory. Moreover, this paſſage may be thus underſtood, <hi>God ſhall be all in all;</hi> that is to ſay, he ſhall be to us all Riches, Glory, Light, Meat, Drink, Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures,
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:41646:264" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In my judgement we cannot conclude from hence, that he is to make all equal.</p>
            <p>If any have other thoughts, or is of another judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I ſhall not offer to condemn him, nor to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take to refute him; for I conceive, that ſeeing Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty God hath hid the Glories and Happineſs of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and covered them over with a thick Cloud, on purpoſe to limit our too curious inquiry; we cannot mention them with too much modeſty and reſpect; only I muſt take notice of ſomething more, for the comfort of the good and devout Souls, whoſe thoughts and mind are in Heaven. That when we affirm, that there ſhall be differing degrees of Glory in Paradiſe, we muſt not conceive that this ſhall bring any dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nution to the perfect Happineſs of the Glorified; for if I may once again make uſe of the compariſon of the Sun-beams, and of the Waters of the Sea, I cannot find any more proper for this purpoſe, As all Eyes that look upon the clear Sun, without Cloud or Miſt, receive its Rayes in a differing manner, yet they have all enough to ſee to guide themſelves, and to rejoyce in this beautiful Light that enlightens them; if ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a greater meaſure of that Light, this hinders not the reſt from enjoying alſo a ſufficiency; ſo ſhall it be with all the glorified Souls, when they ſhall behold God the Father of Lights, the true Sun that ſhall ſhine for ever and ever. If any of them ſhall have more or leſs of his Light, that ſhall in no wiſe impede the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of anothers Happineſs, for every one of them ſhall enjoy as much, as they ſhall be able to receive, or ſhall be neceſſary to compleat their Joy, and perfect their Happineſs. And as when we caſt into the Sea many empty Veſſels, ſome greater ſome leſs, the greater contains more Water, and the leſſer not ſo much: yet they do all receive enough to be filled up to the brim: if the leaſt of theſe Veſſels had
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:41646:265" rendition="simple:additions"/>the knowledge to ſpeak, they would not complain of the greater, for containing more then they, becauſe they have all as much as they can either deſire or expect. Likewiſe, when the Saints ſhall be caſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that bottomleſs Sea of Glory and Happineſs, they ſhall be filled all up to the brim, ſo that they ſhall not be able to deſire any more; they ſhall be all accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their differing capacities, perfectly, and entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly happy. Conſider therefore, <hi>Chriſtian Soul,</hi> that if thou enjoyeſt ſo much ſatisfaction and delight, as thou art capable of, although others may have ſomething more, thou art no leſs happy for their overplus; there is none but God alone, that according to the infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Being, poſſeſſeth an unmeaſurable and infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Glory and Happineſs. This bottomleſs ſource of Glory and Bliſs, ſhall for ever and ever run over all the glorified in Heaven, and ſatisfy their Souls with unſpeakable Delights.</p>
            <p>You may ask, <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> in what part of the great World ſhall God cauſe us to enjoy ſo many rare plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures and Heavenly contentments? Where ſhall he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce ſo many Treaſures and Riches? Where will he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover ſo much Glory and Splendor? In what part doth he intend to ſhew ſo many Divine marks of his Gracious Preſence? I anſwer, that this place is above the Elemental World, above all the Heavens that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear before our Eyes, and that roul about us. If we will underſtand this, we muſt remember, that the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scripture makes mention of three Heavens; The firſt is, the large extent of the Air, diſtinguiſhed by the Learned, into three Regions. In this ſence it is to be taken, when it ſpeaks of the Birds of the Air. The ſecond Heaven comprehends the Heavenly Spheres, the Globes that are between the Moon and the Fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mament, where are all the fixed Stars; and if beyond this, there be any other Sphere, whereof the motion
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:41646:265" rendition="simple:additions"/>is ſo furious and ſwift, as to carry with it the inferior Globes, and to cauſe them to roul round in the ſpace of four and twenty hours. Of this Heaven, <hi>David</hi> ſpeaks in the 19 <hi>Pſalm, The Heavens declare the Glory of God, and the Firmament ſheweth his handy-work, be hath put in them a Tabernacle for the Sun.</hi> Now, above all theſe Heavenly Spheres, mentioned by the Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logers, ſome reckon up nine or ten, and others more. There is yet a third Heaven ſpoken of by <hi>St. Paul,</hi> 2 Cor. 12. <hi>I know,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>a man in Chriſt, which was taken up into the third Heaven; I know that he was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up into Paradiſe, and heard words which cannot be ſpoken, which are not poſſible for Man to utter.</hi> The Holy Apoſtle removes in theſe words, all doubts concerning the place intended by this <hi>Third Heaven,</hi> for he calleth it <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> where he heard unſpeakable words, which are not poſſible to be uttered.</p>
            <p>The Celeſtial Globes rowl about continually, but this Third Heaven, which for its excellency is ſtiled Heaven, is fixed, and without motion in Eternal Reſt. And as much as theſe beautiful Orbs have a greater Light and Glory than the Air, and the inferior Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies; ſo much the more doth this Third Heaven ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel them. It is my judgement, that <hi>Solomon</hi> means this Third Heaven, ſcituate above all the reſt, which exceeds them ſo much in Beauty and Glory, when he ſpeaks to God, <hi>of the Heavens, and of the Heaven of Heavens,</hi> 1 Kings 8. That is to ſay, the moſt Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent, the higheſt, and the moſt Glorious of all the Heavens, <hi>are not able to contain thee,</hi> and God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſaith, by his Holy Prophet, The Heavens are my Throne, and the Earth is my Footſtool, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 66. for in this high Heaven, God hath placed his Throne, where he diſcovers his Glory, and the brightneſs of his ſurprizing Countenance; there the Seraphims fly, and thouſand thouſands worſhip him, and ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:41646:266" rendition="simple:additions"/>Millions ſtand continually before him. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 6. <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. Here it was that the Bleſſed Soul of our Saviour Chriſt was admitted, aſſoon as it had left the Body, according to what he promiſed to the crucified Thief. <hi>Verily I ſay unto thee this day thou ſhalt be with me in Paradiſe, Luk</hi> 23. Hither this Glorious Saviour is aſcended, both in Soul and Body, after his Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection; and here it was that <hi>St. Stephen</hi> ſaw him, when he cryed out, <hi>I ſee the Heavens open, and Jeſus Chriſt fitting at the right hand of God,</hi> Acts 7. And hither it is, that the Souls of all ſuch as dye in his favour, are carried up. Therefore <hi>St. Paul</hi> to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions immediately, after the thouſands of Angels, <hi>The Spirits of juſt Men made perfect, and the Church and Congregation of the firſt-born, whoſe names are written in Heaven.</hi> In ſhort, it is the Glorious Seat, where we hope that God will receive us, both in Soul and Body, at that day, when we ſhall be taken up into the Air, above the Clouds of Heaven, to be for ever with the Lord Jeſus.</p>
            <p>Some inquire then what ſhall become of this Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental World? whether this Heaven that appears to our Eyes, and this Earth which ſuſtains us, ſhall periſh? or whether they ſhall remain yet after the great day of Doom?</p>
            <p>Certain prophane Atheiſts are perſwaded, that the World ſhall remain for ever, as it doth at preſent, and that there ſhall be no manner of alteration. The Apoſtle <hi>St. Peter</hi> hath Propheſied of theſe Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and deſcribed them in their own Colours, <hi>There ſhall come at the laſt day mockers, walking after their own Luſts, ſaying, where is the promiſe of his coming, for ſince the Fathers are aſleep, all things continue in the ſame manner, ſince the beginning of the World.</hi> I need not trouble my ſelf in a refutation of ſuch impieties; I ſpeak to none but to the devout Souls, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:41646:266"/>the Divinity of the Holy Scriptures, and are fully perſwaded of the Truth of all the Articles of our Creed.</p>
            <p>It oft-times happens, when Men oppoſe a falſe Doctrine, and an erroneous opinion, they run from one extremity to another; therefore ſome imagine, that the World ſhall totally periſh: and that as God hath called the Heavens and Earth, and the reſt of the Elements out of nothing, he will reduce them all again into the ſame Nothing, and that he intends to create others, more beautiful, more Holy, and far more Glorious. There are two kinds of expreſſions that ſeem to favor this opinion. The firſt, which ſpeaks of the Heavens and of the Earth, as of periſhing and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caying Creatures. In this manner <hi>David</hi> diſcourſeth of them in 102 <hi>Pſalm,</hi> and after him, the Apoſtle to the <hi>Hebrews, Thou Lord, haſt eſtabliſhed the Earth and the Heavens are the Works of thy hands, they ſhall periſh, but thou ſhalt endure, they ſhall wax old as doth a Garment, and as a Veſture ſhalt thou fold them up, and theyſhall be changed.</hi> And our Saviour tells us in the 24 of <hi>St. Matt.</hi> The Heavens and the Earth ſhall paſs away, but my Words ſhall not paſs away. Eſpecially, the words of <hi>St. Peter,</hi> in the 2 Epiſtle, and the 3 Chapter, are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable, <hi>The Heavens ſhall paſs away with a noiſe, and the Elements ſhall melt with heat, and the Earth with the works that are therein, ſhall be burnt up.</hi> The other paſſages mention new Heavens, and a new Earth, as in the 65 of <hi>Iſaiah;</hi> Behold, I create new Heavens, and a new Earth, and the former things ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred no more. Likewiſe in the fore-mentioned Chapter, the 3 of the 2 Epiſtle of <hi>St. Peter, We look for new Heavens, and a new Earth, according to his promiſe, wherein dwelleth Righteouſneſs.</hi> And in the 21 Revel. <hi>I ſaw a new Heaven and a new Earth, for the firſt Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and the firſt Earth were paſſed away, and there was no
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:41646:267" rendition="simple:additions"/>more Sea.</hi> Moreover, <hi>St. Paul</hi> to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> ſpeaks of the <hi>World to come;</hi> from hence ſome conclude that the old World ought to be aboliſhed, and that God ſhall create a new World.</p>
            <p>There is no man that is a Chriſtian, can doubt of that wonderful change, which ſhall happen to the world, at the laſt day, if he conſiders the fore-mentioned paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of Holy Scripture, eſpecially that of <hi>St. Peter, The Heavens ſhall paſs away with a noiſe, and the Elements ſhall melt with heat, and the Earth with the Works that are therein.</hi> So that as the Walls of <hi>Jerico</hi> fell at the ſound of the Prieſts Trumpets; Likewiſe this great world ſhall be turned upſide down, at the blowing of the Arch-Angels Trumpet. Our Reaſon alone being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened by Divine Revelation, ſeems to confirm this Truth; for ſeeing that the Houſe infected with a ſpread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Leproſy, was to be demoliſhed, how much the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhould the world be deſtroyed becauſe in it is to be ſeen apparently, the ſpots and blemiſhes of ſin, the Spiritual Leproſy.</p>
            <p>But although this great Fabrick of the World, ought to be ruined, and turned upſide down; we do not believe, that it ſhall be reduc'd to nothing, its quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties ſhall be changed, and it may be its form ſhall be altered, but its ſubſtance and matter ſhall continue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways the ſame: for Firſt, As God hath created the World for his own Glory, he cannot be diſappointed of the intent of his Creation. And becauſe this world hath not glorified him as it ought, he will put it into a condition proper to glorify him, according to that purpoſe, for which he drew it out of nothing. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Seeing that this World was created to ſerve Man, as a Looking-Glaſs, to behold the Eternal Power of God, and that this beautiful Looking-Glaſs hath been ſpotted and ſullied by ſin, It is yet poſſible to cleanſe it, and make it brighter, that it might repreſent its
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:41646:267" rendition="simple:additions"/>Creator better, and ſhew forth a more perfect Image of his Divine Majeſty. Thirdly, Seeing that God doth nothing in vain, there is no likelyhood that he ſhould deſtroy the World totally, and reduce the primitive Matter, to nothing, from whence it is drawn, to create new Matter, becauſe he is able of this old Matter, to make a new Earth, and new Heaven, as pure and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defiled, as if the Matter had been newly created. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Sin hath ſpoiled and disfigured the Works of the Creation, but it hath not touched, neither the firſt Matter nor its Being, ſo that God can take away this defilement, and remove the deformity, without touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Matter, which of it ſelf is innocent and harmleſs. In Man, the little World and the compendium of the great, I find a beautiful and perfect Image of that which God ſhall do with the whole World. God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends not to deſtroy the ſubſtance of our Souls, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to purge them from all vicious qualities, and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify them with Righteouſneſs and true Holineſs; ſo that they ſhall be as the Angels of Heaven. Likewiſe, he intends not to deſtroy the ſubſtance of our Bodies, but he will free them from corruption, from death, and cloath them with Glory and Immortality; ſo that this vile Body ſhall be rendred conformable to the glorious Body of the Son of God, and ſhall ſhine as the Sun. Likewiſe, God will not altogether deſtroy the World, and aboliſh its ſubſtance, but he will recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy all its imperfections, and add to it a greater Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. If it be lawful for me to diſcover here all my thoughts; I muſt ſay, that I put a great difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Heaven and Earth, for the Earth is altogether corrupt and ſpoiled with ſin; it is the Earth, eſpecially, that groans under the burden of ſo many iniquities, which reign in it; but if Heaven is guilty of any crime, it is, becauſe it hath given Light to ſuch as have been Rebels againſt the Divine Majeſty, and aſſiſted the curſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Earth by its Gracious and continual influences. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:41646:268" rendition="simple:additions"/>of this great difference, it is my opinion, that the Earth ſhall be deſtroyed by Fire, and that all its beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful Buildings, and proud Palaces ſhall be turned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Aſhes; but the change which ſhall happen in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, ſhall only be to make it more beautiful and bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, that Children of God might have there a more Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Palace. This ſeems to have been typified in the ceremonial Law; for as we have already obſerved ſpeaking of that which ſhall happen to the Soul and Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, that when an Earthen Veſſel was defiled, it was to be broken to pieces, but ſuch Veſſels as were of a more precious Metal, as of Braſs, of Silver, or of Gold, were to be purified with Fire. Likewiſe the Earth, with all its works, ſhall paſs through the Flames, ſo that it ſhall looſe its preſent ſhape and qualities. But Heaven, that is as Braſs, or rather as fine Silver, ſhall only he purifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Fire of the laſt Judgement. If you remove the cauſe, you take away alſo the effect; if you remove away ſin, you alſo remove its puniſhment. Now it is, becauſe of Man's ſin, that the World hath, and ſhall ſee ſo great a change. Therefore, as God by his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Mercy, hath forgiven Man's ſin; it is alſo to be expected from the ſame Mercy, that he will not totally deſtroy the World, but that he will rather free it from corruption, unto which our ſins had enthral'd it.</p>
            <p>Unleſs God deals in this manner, our Joy and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort cannot be accompliſhed, and God will not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear perfectly ſatisfied. While a Subject continues in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, and in the diſpleaſure of his Prince; not only his perſon is purſued and puniſhed, but all that belongs to him, bears the marks of the wrath and indignation of the Prince, whom he hath offended; his dwelling Houſe is commonly pulled down, his Woods are cut and mangled, and his Inheritance is deſtroyed; but when his Peace is concluded, and his pardon granted, his houſes are built up again, al ſigns of the King's diſpleaſure are taken away, and
<pb n="529" facs="tcp:41646:268" rendition="simple:additions"/>every thing appears with a more pleaſant countenance; likewiſe, becauſe of our Rebellion and our Treaſon againſt God, he hath puniſhed the World for our ſakes, and hath made it ſenſible of his wrath. But now that our peace is made, or rather, God having made peace by the blood of his Son, we may juſtly expect that he will remove all ſigns of his diſpleaſure and revenge. I remember upon this ſubject, what <hi>David</hi> ſaith to God, when he ſaw the Angels deſtroying <hi>Jeruſalem, I have ſinned, and I have done wickedly, but theſe Sheep, what have they done?</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24. In the ſame manner every Believer may ſay unto God, Lo, I have ſinned O Lord, I and my Brethren have done wickedly, but theſe inaminate Creatures, what have they done? our ſins have defiled the Earth, and all things that may be objected againſt Heaven, it is, to have yiel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Light and aſſiſtance to us Rebels. Seeing therefore that thou haſt blotted out our Sins, and pardoned our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellions, ſpare theſe harmleſs Creatures, which are puniſhed only for our ſakes.</p>
            <p>At preſent we can find no difficulty to underſtand the forementioned paſſages of holy Scripture, and ſuch as tend to the ſame purpoſe. For when <hi>David</hi> and St. <hi>Paul</hi> aſſure us, <hi>That the Heavens ſhall periſh, that they ſhall be changed as a garment.</hi> I anſwer, that they ſhall periſh, in reſpect of their qualities. and not of their ſubſtance; and that the change ſhall not be, as when one Garment is caſt off. and another is taken; but as when the ſpots and ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhes of an old Garment are taken away, and it becomes freſher. When your cloathing is grown old and worn out, if it were in your power to make it become new again, and as freſh as ever it was, you ſhould never dream of ſeeking for new Stuffe. That which is impoſſible to Men, is poſſible with God, <hi>Luke</hi> 6. And when our Saviour in St. <hi>Mathew's</hi> Goſpel, ſaith, <hi>That the Heavens and the Earth ſhall paſs away, but my words ſhall not paſs away;</hi> I might ſay, that theſe words are to be underſtood com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratively, that is to ſay, that the Heavens and the Earth
<pb n="530" facs="tcp:41646:269" rendition="simple:additions"/>ſhall paſs away, rather then that the words of God ſhould fail of an accompliſhment; our Saviour confirms this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation, when he ſaith in St. <hi>Lukes</hi> Goſpel, It is eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er for Heaven and Earth to paſs away, then that one tittle of the Law ſhould not be fulfilled. The Holy Scripture is full of ſuch kind of expreſſions, but I would rather ſtick to the anſwers which I have already given to the former paſſages, and to ſay, that the Heavens and the Earth ſhall paſs away, not in regard of their ſubſtance, but only in regard of their accidental qualities.</p>
            <p>In St. <hi>Peters</hi> expreſſions, I find a double compariſon, or alluſion, the one relates to the Tents that are pulled down, when the pieces are taken aſunder. This compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon is very proper, for this World is like a great Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle, a glorious Pavillion, God ſhall pull off all the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verings, he ſhall cut the Cords, and ſeparate every piece. But he ſhall one day raiſe it up again, gather every piece; and make it a Royal Tabernacle, full of ſplendor and glory.</p>
            <p>The other compariſon is borrowed from Goldſmiths, who caſt the Gold and Metals into pots, and then melt them in the fire: Now as they do not deſtroy, by this means, the Gold and the Silver, but they cleanſe it from droſſe and from dirt, they cauſe them to appear in all their brightneſs and beauty, and give them a new ſhape and form. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the fire of the laſt Judgement, ſhall not conſume the Heavens and the Earth, but ſhall only give them a new form and beauty.</p>
            <p>The ſtrangeſt objection in my opinion, is occaſioned by the words of St. <hi>Peter, The Earth and the Works that are therein ſhall be burnt up;</hi> But I anſwer to this, that there is a great difference between burning, and being totally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed and aboliſhed. If it were in the power of a Man, whoſe Houſe is burned to the ground, to raiſe it up again from its ruines, and to make it more beautiful and glorious then before, by his word alone, he would never ſeek for other Materials. Now I ſhall ſay again, that what is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
<pb n="531" facs="tcp:41646:269" rendition="simple:additions"/>with Men, is poſſible with God, he hath already Created the World by his Word, and he is able to reſtore it again by the ſame word. Art hath found a way to make beautiful Veſſels of melted aſhes, and ſhall not Gods Hand, unto which all the skill of Art, and the ſtrength of Nature, cannot be compared, be able to gather up the aſhes of this Earth, and to make of it a Body full of glory and light?</p>
            <p>From hence you may perceive, how we are to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that there ſhall be new Heavens and a new Earth; they ſhall not be new in regard of their ſubſtance and matter, which ſhall have been from the beginning of the World; but they ſhall be new in regard of thoſe noble qualities which God ſhall give them. When a debaucht fellow leaves his wicked life, and applies himſelf to the practice of Piety and Vertue, we commonly ſay, that he is not the ſame, but that he is become another Man. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, when a Man hath caſt off his old rags, and puts on a glorious Garment, we are wont to ſay, that he is another Man. We ſhall have much more cauſe to ſay, that the Heavens and the Earth ſhall be new, when God ſhall have renewed them. In ſhort, he ſhall enrich the World, with ſo many wonderful beauties, he ſhall fill it full of ſo much glory and excellency, he ſhall cauſe it to be ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, that we ſhall have juſt reaſon to look upon it, as up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a New World, and to ſay with the Apoſtle, <hi>The old things are paſſed away, behold all things are become new.</hi> I would not have you think, <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> that this opinion is grounded only upon humane reaſon, it is drawn from the words of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who ſpeaking of the earthly and inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Creatures, as may appear by his intention, he ſaith, not only <hi>that they are ſubject to Vanity, not willingly, but becauſe of him who hath ſubjected them,</hi> he means Man, who by his Sin and Rebellion hath ſpoiled the World, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted Nature; but he adds immediately after, <hi>That they hope to be delivered from the Bondage of corruption, to be in the glorious liberty of the Children of God;</hi> afterwards he
<pb n="532" facs="tcp:41646:270" rendition="simple:additions"/>ſaith, <hi>for we know that the whole Creation groaneth and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaileth in pain together until now;</hi> and before he ſaith, <hi>That the earneſt expectation of the Creature, waiteth for the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtation of the Sons of God.</hi> In which paſſages pray take notice, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith not, that theſe Creatures ſhall be aboliſhed and totally deſtroyed, but only, that they ſhall be delivered from Vanity, and from the bondage of corruption, unto which the Sin of Man hath made them ſubject; and that this bleſſed deliverance ſhall be brought to paſs, at the day of the Redemption of our Bodies, that is to ſay, at that day when God ſhall redeem our Bodies from their Graves, and raiſe them up to the higheſt glory and happineſs, which hath been prepared for us from the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the World.</p>
            <p>Then ſhall happen that which is wont to be ſeen, at the Marriage of a great King, or at a Coronation, or a Triumph, for not only the Prince and his Spouſe, and all their Court appear, in their richeſt and moſt glorious Attire, and loa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den with their moſt precious Jewels, and the uſual Pompe of Triumphs, was as extraordinary and glorious, as In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention could make it. In ſuch occaſions, the Princes Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace is adorned with the richeſt, with the moſt magnificent and rareſt ornaments; and the Town where this Solemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is kept, ſhews forth ſome Signs of the publick rejoycing; many places are beautified with ſeveral Rarities, Theaters are erected, the Streets are covered with Flowers and Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtry, fires are kindled, and Torches are lighted, and there is no corner but ſhews ſome expreſſions of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick joy. Likewiſe, when our Lord Jeſus Chriſt ſhall come down from the Clouds of Heaven, upon a Charriot of Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph, when he ſhall come to conſummate his Marriage with, and to Crown his Spouſe. He ſhall not only appear in his greateſt Glory, and moſt Divine Pomp, but the Church alſo his Spouſe, ſhall be cloathed with a Garment brighter than the Sun, and Crowned with an Immortal Glory. All the Bleſſed Saints ſhall appear in their attire of Joy, having Palms in their Hands, and Crowns upon their
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:41646:270" rendition="simple:additions"/>Heads, and the Companies of Holy Angels ſhall ſing round about. At that time Paradice, which ſhall be as his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace and Bridechamber, ſhall be adorned and enriched with all the light anp glory, which I have already eſſayed to deſcribe unto you. The whole World alſo, and every part of it, ſhall partake of this great Glory, and Celeſtial Pomp. The richeſt Coronations, the moſt Magnificent Triumphs, the moſt ſtately Nuptials, are gone in a few hours; Therefore the fires of Joy are ſoon put out, the hangings of the Streets are taken down, and the Arches and Pageants diſappear, and the City is to be ſeen in its wonted dreſs. But as this Glory and Joy of the Church ſhall never end; Therefore the World ſhall for ever and ever bear the ſigns of it. The Ornaments which it ſhall receive in this joyful day, ſhall never be taken away, and the Celeſtial fires of gladneſs, ſhall never go out.</p>
            <p>Although it is my opinion, that the World ſhall never be totally Deſtroyed, but that it ſhall become more beautiful and glorious than before. I ſhall not undertake to give you a deſcription of its ſeveral parts, nor to tell you how it ſhall be employed; for example, I ſhall not determine whether we are to underſtand our Saviours words in the Goſpel, literally, <hi>That the Sun ſhall become Dark, that the Moon ſhall not give its Light, and that the Stars ſhall fall from Heaven;</hi> or whether theſe Heavenly Bodies ſhall ſtill continue, whether they ſhall be decked with a new Light and Glory, and to what purpoſe they ſhall ſerve; for then we ſhall be enlightned with a greater Light, then that of all the Heavenly Bodies. I ſhall only propoſe two Things; Firſt, That as in the humane Body there are ſome Members, which at preſent are uſeful, but then they ſhall only be for Ornament and Beauty. Likewiſe in the great World, there are many needful things, which ſhall then be of no uſe, nevertheleſs, they ſhall be preſerved for the Beauty and Perfection of the World. Secondly, That as Man the little World, ſhall then be more Beautiful and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, then when God firſt Created him; likewiſe this
<pb n="534" facs="tcp:41646:271" rendition="simple:additions"/>great World ſhall receive more Beauty, more Ornaments and Perfection, then when God drew it out of its firſt Chaos. As much difference as there is between the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> and the firſt, between the Heavenly Paradice and the Earthly; ſo much there ſhall be between the firſt and ſecond World. So that we ſhall have good cauſe to ſay of this great Palace, which is to be deſtroyed, and reared up again by the Almighty hand of God, as the Holy Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets ſaid of <hi>Solomons</hi> Temple, which we have already ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to our glorified Bodies. <hi>The glory of this ſecond Houſe, ſhall be greater than the glory of the firſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some inquire whether we ſhall know one another in this State of Eternal Glory and happineſs, I mean, whether the Subject ſhall know his Prince and King; whether the Sheep ſhall know their Shepheard, and the Shepheard his Sheep; whether the Father ſhall know his Son, the Son the Father, the Husband his Wife, and the Wife her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, and ſo forth.</p>
            <p>Although this queſtion is of the number of ſuch as are more curious, then needful to be known; nevertheleſs, a reply ſeems to bring with it ſome kind of comfort and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction. I ſhould judge that this Treatiſe ſhould not be perfect, if I did not ſay ſomething to this matter, but what I ſhall ſay, ſhall be with the ſame moderation and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervedneſs, as I have expreſſed in anſwering to the former queſtions; for although what I ſhall ſpeak, ſeems to me very plain and without any difficulty; others may have different thoughts, without any prejudice to their Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. However, I may eſtabliſh for an infallible Truth, That the Glory of Heaven, as well as Grace, ſhall bring Nature to perfection, but ſhall not deſtroy it, it ſhall add to it other excellencies, but ſhall not take away thoſe that it hath already. It ſhall not aboliſh any of the Faculties, but it ſhall beautifie and enrich them with new Ornaments. Therefore by conſequence, it ſhall not take away our Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, which is one of the rareſt gifts and abilities, of the reaſonable Soul.</p>
            <pb n="535" facs="tcp:41646:271" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p>I confeſs that it is ſaid, <hi>That the former things ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred no more, and that they ſhall come no more into our mind.</hi> But this is to be underſtood of the evils and cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities of this preſent life. And we are not to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the words, ſo that to ſpeak plainly, we ſhall totally forget all the former evils and miſeries, and that we ſhall not remember to have undergone them; St. <hi>John</hi> ſaith the contrary, when he repreſents the Angel opening the fifth Seal, that he ſaw under the Golden Altar, which was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Throne of God, the Souls of them who had been Martyred for the Word of God, and for the Teſtimony of the Truth, crying out with a loud voice, <hi>How long O Lord, Holy and True, doſt thou not judge and revenge our Blood, upon the Inhabitants of the Earth.</hi> It is true, theſe words may be underſtood in a figurative ſenſe, as when God ſaid unto <hi>Cain, The voice of thy Brothers Bloodcries from the Earth unto me;</hi> and as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>That the Blood of Jeſus Chriſt ſpeaks better things, than the Blood of</hi> Abel. However, from hence we may conclude, that the remembrance of all the Miſeries and Evils which we have endured in this Life, is not repugnant to our future eſtate of glory. This remembrance is ſo far from prejudicing our felicity, that on the contrary, it ſhall increaſe and inlarge it; ſo that it ſhall cauſe it to appear ſweeter and more pleaſant When the Prophet ſaith, <hi>That the former things ſhall be remembered no more, that they ſhall never come to mind;</hi> he underſtands that the former evils ſhall never be felt, and that we ſhall be for ever ſheltered from all Miſery and Misfortunes.</p>
            <p>I cannot expreſs this by a nobler and more proper exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, then that of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> when he went out of Priſon to take into his hands the Government of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and that he had ſtrengthened himſelf, by a rich Alliance in Marriage, he named his eldeſt Son <hi>Manaſſeth,</hi> which ſignifies <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getfulneſs, or forgetful; for he ſaid, God hath made me for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get all my labor, and my Fathers Houſe.</hi> Although this holy Manhd not forgotten altogether all thoſe things, for he
<pb n="536" facs="tcp:41646:272" rendition="simple:additions"/>knew afterwards his Brethren, and told them of the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, which they had intended againſt him, and which God had turned to good. But he ſpoke in this manner, becauſe God had changed his Miſery and impriſonment, into glory and honour. In this ſenſe we are to underſtand theſe words, <hi>The former things ſhall be remembred no more,</hi> becauſe inſtead of the Evils and Miſeries which we endure here below, we ſhall enter into an Eternal Glory and Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs. The Prophet expounds himſelf ſufficiently, in the next words, for when he had ſaid, <hi>The former things ſhall not be remembred, nor come into mind,</hi> he adds immediately after, <hi>be you glad and rejoyce in that which I Create.</hi> The Holy Ghoſt confirms us in this interpretation in another place, by theſe words, <hi>All Tears ſhall be wiped off from our eyes, there ſhall be no more ſorrow, nor crying, nor pain, but eternal Joy and Gladneſs ſhall be upon our heads.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Seeing God intends not to deſtroy thoſe gifts and abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, which he hath beſtowed upon us in this Life, much leſs ſhall he aboliſh our knowledge, which is one of the brighteſt Beams of his Glory. This knowledge ſhall be ſo far from diminiſhing or decaying, that it ſhall then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe more and more, until it comes to the higheſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and glory. As the Air looſeth nothing of its twi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light at break of day, when the Sun riſeth upon our heads, but rather looſeth all obſcurity and darkneſs, which the preſence of the Sun drives away, untill it be perfectly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened. Likewiſe our underſtanding ſhall looſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of that light and perfection which it receives now from the breaking of the day of Gods Grace; but as the Son of Righteouſneſs riſeth upon i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> more and more in joy and Salvation, it ſhall perfectly looſe all Darkneſs and Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance by degrees, until it be fully enlightned. From hence it ſeems we may conclude, that we ſhall know all the perſons in Heaven, whom we have known here below on Earth; for if the glorified ſhall remember the wicked who have Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented them, they muſt needs remember alſo Believers, who have beſtowed upon them their Alms, and done them
<pb n="537" facs="tcp:41646:272" rendition="simple:additions"/>good. If it were otherwiſe, the Apoſtle St. <hi>Paul</hi> would not tell the <hi>Corinthians, We are your glory, as alſo you are ours, at the day of the Lord Jeſus;</hi> And he would not write thus to the <hi>Theſſalo. What is our hope, our joy, and our Crown of Glory? Is it not you before the Lord Jeſus Chriſt at his coming? verily you are our glory and our joy.</hi> Now if in the eſtate of Glory, St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſhould not know the <hi>Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> and <hi>Theſſalo</hi> unto whom he had Preached the Goſpel; how ſhall they be his Joy, his Glory, and his Crown, at the coming of the Lord Jeſus? This reaſon ſeems to me as clear as the Sun. Nevertheleſs, I cannot affirm, that in Heaven we ſhall know again them whom we have known upon Earth, by the features of their countenance, for there ſhall be a wonderful alteration. The faces of all the Saints ſhall be ſo beautiful, ſo perfect, and ſo full of light and glory, that the moſt knowing ſhall not be able to judge them to be the ſame, whom we have ſeen upon Earth. Some therefore fancy, that we ſhall know one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the aſſiſtance of the diſcourſe; but our voice ſhall then be changed, as well as our countenance, and it is doubtful, whether we ſhall diſcourſe of the former things happened on Earth, for our chief employment ſhall be to behold Gods face, and to ſing forth his praiſes. I had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther therefore affirm, that we ſhall know one another by an infuſed knowledge, by which we ſhall know all things, which are poſſibly to be known, and by the light of that glory with which God ſhall fill our Souls. In ſhort, this knowledge ſhall proceed from no other principle, then that of all the knowledges which we ſhall have in that State of Glory and Perfection.</p>
            <p>I am therefore more than fully perſwaded, that we ſhall know in Heaven our Parents and our Friends, and generally all the perſons whom we have known here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, but we ſhall alſo perfectly know them, whom we never knew in the World, and never ſaw with he eyes of the fleſh. We ſhall know the holy and Bleſſed Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> the Patriarks, the Prophets, the Apoſtles, the Evangeliſts,
<pb n="538" facs="tcp:41646:273" rendition="simple:additions"/>the Confeſſors, the Martyrs, and generally, without excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, all the Saints who ſhall be Crowned with Glory and joy in Heaven. There is no body can queſtion, but that in the Celeſtial Paradice, we ſhall have more knowledge and underſtanding, then ever <hi>Adam</hi> had in the earthly. Now when God cauſed a deep ſleep to fall upon him, when he took one of his Ribs, and formed therewith a Woman, he had ſeen none of this done, nevertheleſs, when his eyes were open, he knew her, therefore he declared his judgement in this manner, <hi>This is bone of my bone, and fleſh of my fleſh.</hi> And ſhall not we when God ſhall rouſe us up from the deep ſleep of Death, with the ſound of the laſt Trumpet, know the Spouſe of the Son of God, which he hath drawn out of his ſide, and faſhioned with his own precious Blood? St. <hi>Peter</hi> when he was enlightned by a beam of our Saviours Glory in his tranſfiguration, knew <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> whom he had never ſeen before. And ſhall not we know all the Children of God upon Mount <hi>Sion,</hi> when we ſhall be tranſfigured our ſelves, and that we ſhall ſhine all as the heavenly light, whereof that of Mount <hi>Tabor,</hi> was but an imperfect ſhadow and repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. But although we ſhall know in Heaven all the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons whom we have known on Earth, we ſhall look upon them in another manner, and love them with another af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, for all that we have of the animal and earthly life, ſhall be totally aboliſhed; and as our knowledge ſhall be clear and certain, our love ſhall be pure and heavenly. I am not able to expreſs this better than St. <hi>Paul</hi> doth, in theſe words, <hi>Although I have known Chriſt according to the fleſh, nevertheleſs I know him no more according to the fleſh. Chriſtians,</hi> conſider well theſe expreſſions, they will be able to remove all difficulty and doubts out of your minds. We are all fully perſwaded, that all the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of Heaven, ſhall know very well our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, for how can it be otherwiſe, but that we muſt know this glorious Monarch of Men and of Angels, whoſe ſacred countenance ſhall ſhine as the Sun, and who ſhall
<pb n="539" facs="tcp:41646:273" rendition="simple:additions"/>ſit upon his Magnificent Throne, about which Legions of <hi>Seraphims</hi> flie, and who ſhall be there adored for ever, by all the Church glorified. Nevertheleſs St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>That although he hath known Jeſus Chriſt according to the fleſh;</hi> That is to ſay, according to the manner of this low and earthly life, when he lived here on Earth; at preſent he did not know him in the ſame manner, he did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider him otherwiſe, but as he is at preſent inveſted, with an unſpeakable Glory and ſplendor. In the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, although we ſhall know all them whom we have known on Earth, we ſhall no more know them according to the fleſh, that is to ſay; according to this animal and ſenſual life, our love ſhall have nothing of earthly or carnal, but it ſhall be altogether Spiritual and Heavenly.</p>
            <p>I beſeech you Chriſtians, conſider well what St. <hi>Math.</hi> tells us in 22. Chap. The <hi>Saduces</hi> who ſay, that there is no Reſurrection, came to Chriſt to intangle him with this difficult queſtion. <hi>Maſter,</hi> Moſes <hi>ſaid, if a Man Die having no Children, his Brother ſhall Marry his Wife, and raiſe up ſeed unto his Brother. Now there were with us ſeven Brethren, and the firſt when he had Married a Wiſe Deceaſed, and having no Iſſue, left his Wife unto his Brother; likewiſe the ſecond alſo, and the third, unto the ſeventh, and laſt of all the Woman Died alſo; therefore in the Reſurrection whoſe Wife ſhall ſhe be of the ſeven, for they all had her?</hi> Our Saviour anſwers not that this Woman ſhall belong to none of thoſe Husbands, becauſe they ſhall not know her, nor diſtinguiſh her from other Women, but he replyes to them, <hi>you err not knowing the Scriptures, nor the power of God, for in the Reſurrection they neither Marry nor are gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in Marriage, but are as the Angels of God in Heaven.</hi> From hence we may conclude, that although in Heaven we ſhall know one another, we ſhall have nothing of that carnal love which we have at preſent, and which cauſeth us to put ſo much difference between one perſon and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. A father may know his Children, but his love ſhall not be grounded upon conſiderations of fleſh and blood;
<pb n="540" facs="tcp:41646:274" rendition="simple:additions"/>he ſhall love them only, becauſe they are amongſt the Children of God, and the Heirs of his Kingdom, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he ſhall ſee them appear in the Image of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Father, cloathed with his Light, and Crowned with his Immortal Glory. Finally, we ſhall love no body but in God, and for his ſake, as they ſhall be in God and God in them. In this manner it ſhall not be poſſible to love them more or leſs. Charity or Love the Queen of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, ſhall then ſit upon its Throne, and attain to its high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt degree and perfection.</p>
            <p>If you think ſeriouſly upon this, <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> you ſhall eaſily find arguments to anſwer the vain objections of ſuch as ſay, that if we come to the knowledge of one another in Heaven, that ſhall be able to diſturb our ſatisfaction and reſt; for as it will be a comfort and joy to meet there with our Parents and Friends; in like manner it will be a trouble and diſſatisfaction, not to find there all ſuch whom we have formerly loved. We may retort the ſame objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in a ſtronger manner againſt thoſe that believe that we ſhall not know one another in Heaven, for we may ſay alſo, that if we know not the perſons, we ſhall not know whether our Parents or our Friends are there; and that this is as likely to diſturbe and trouble the quiet and ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of our minds. But to argue in this groſs manner, is to confound Heaven with the Earth.</p>
            <p>Grief and diſpleaſure can never be admitted in a Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice of joy and perfect happineſs. In this glorious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, our knowledge ſhall be ſo clear, our Charity ſo pure, our Love for God ſo ſervent, that as we ſhall love all things which God ſhall love, and where his Image ſhall appear, ſo it ſhall not be poſſible for us to love them whom God ſhall hate, them who ſhall bear the marks and ſimilitudes of the Devil.</p>
            <p>When <hi>David</hi> was yet here on Earth, he ſaid unto God, <hi>Lord ſhall not I hate them that hate thee? I hate them with a perfect hatred, they have been to me as mine Enemies,</hi> Pſ. 39. In the ſame manner we ſhall rather ſpeak in Heaven, in the
<pb n="541" facs="tcp:41646:274" rendition="simple:additions"/>eſtate of perfection, when God ſhall be in us all in all, and we ſhall be all in God. Some there are that inquire what kind of language we ſhall ſpeak in Heaven? ſome reply, that we ſhall ſpeak the Language of Angels, groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding their opinion upon what St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks to the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians, When I ſhould ſpeak with the Tongues of Men and Angels, If I have not charity, I am become as ſounding Braſs and a tinkling Simbal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this is a <hi>Chimerian</hi> opinion, for as the Angels are pure Spirits, by conſequence they can have no Tongue, nor proper language. I confeſs in ſome holy Apparitions, Angels have ſpoken to Men, but it was by moving the Tongues of their borrowed Bodies, or by employing ſome other corporal Organ, then they did ſpeak in the Language of thoſe unto whom they were ſent, they had no particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar or proper Dialect. But if Angels did ſpeak, their Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage would excell, as much that of Men, as the Angeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Nature excells the Humane; by the Tongues of Angels therefore our Apoſtle underſtands an excellent Tongue, better then that of Men.</p>
            <p>Others fancy, that in Heaven we ſhall ſpeak no other Language, but the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> becauſe ſay they, that it is the Tongue which God hath Sanctified from the beginning of the World, in which he ſpoke to the Patriarcks and Holy Prophets, in which he proclaimed his Law upon Mount <hi>Sina,</hi> in the audience of all the People of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and in which he hath Recorded his Sacred Law, with his own Finger. They ſay, that it is the Language which <hi>Adam</hi> did ſpeak in the Earthly Paradice, in the ſtate of innocency, and which all the Inhabitants of the World did ſpeak before God, ſent amongſt them a Diviſion of Tongues. Others are yet of opinion, that as then we ſhall attain to all Knowledge and Sciences, we ſhall not be ignorant of all kind of Languages, but that we ſhall ſpeak them all in a moſt perfect manner, and that with them we ſhall declare the wonderful Works of God, as the Apoſtles did at the day of <hi>Pentecoſt.</hi> As the holy Scripture is ſilent up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this matter, I ſhall affirm nothing.</p>
            <pb n="542" facs="tcp:41646:275" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p>But in general terms, I may ſay, that as God cauſed a diviſion of Tongues to puniſh Mans inſolency and pride, and that as the differing Languages of People, is an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of their Sin; it is moſt certain, that this confuſion and difference ſhall be altogether taken away, and that nothing ſhall be ſaid in Heaven, but ſhall be very well underſtood by all the glorified Saints. I may add moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, that in caſe we ſhould ſpeak ſo well all manner of Languages which have been in the World, it is neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs very likely, that we ſhall all ſpeak but one Language, that we may all praiſe God with the ſame voice; but whether this ſhall be the Holy Language, or another more perfect and majeſtick, which God ſhall ſanctifie for this purpoſe, we cannot know, until God of his infinite Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy ſhall have raiſed us to this eſtate of Glory and perfect Happineſs. From what we have already ſaid, <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> you may eaſily underſtand, that our happineſs hath three ſteps or degrees; the firſt is attainable in this Life, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond at the Egreſs of the Soul out of the Body, the third at the great day of our glorious Reſurrection; for alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in this Life, God beſtows upon us the Firſt-Fruits of his Glory, and the fore-taſts of Heaven. The Spirit of God and of his Glory, reſts at preſent upon us, which fills us full of an unſpeakable glorious joy, and with the peace of God which ſurpaſſeth all underſtanding. When our Souls depart out of this wretched and craſie Body, God gathers them up into the bundle of Life, he introduceth them into the bleſſed company of the Angels and Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied Spirits, and admits them to the Contemplation of his Face, which is fulneſs of Joy. But in this joyful day when Chriſt ſhall come down from Heaven to judge the quick and the dead, he will carry us both in Soul and Body to the higheſt Glory and Happineſs whereof we are capable; for this reaſon the Name of Glory is aſcribed to this high degree of happineſs, which is promiſed to us at the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed appearing of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, as in the 8 Chap. to the <hi>Romans,</hi> where the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>That the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="543" facs="tcp:41646:275" rendition="simple:additions"/>was made ſubject to vanity, not willingly, but by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of him who hath ſubjected the ſame, in hope, becauſe the Creature it ſelf ſhall be delivered from the Bondage of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, into the glorious liberty of the Children of God. And in the</hi> 3. Chap. <hi>to the</hi> Coloſ. he ſaith, <hi>you are Dead, and your Life is hid with Chriſt in God, when Chriſt who is your Life ſhall appear, you ſhall appear alſo with him in Glory.</hi> Therefore this glorious appearing is ſtiled, <hi>a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Hope,</hi> that is to ſay, the fulfilling and accompliſhment of all that we expect or hope for, as in the 2 Chap. to <hi>Titus,</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>We expect the Bleſſed Hope, the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing of the Glory of our great God, who is the Saviour Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then ſhall be the conſummation of the Glory, and of the head, and of the Members, for then the Son of God ſhall cauſe the Damned to feel that Power which he poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſeth in Heaven and in Earth, and in the Depths; he ſhall diſcover himſelf to the faithful, in his greateſt Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and moſt Divine Splendor. Therefore this glorious Day of his deſcent from Heaven, with the Angels of his power, is mentioned as the firſt day of his <hi>manifeſtation,</hi> of his <hi>appearing,</hi> and of <hi>his Kingdom;</hi> for this cauſe, when the Holy Ghoſt ſpeaks of this day, it ſtiles it, <hi>The day of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> or <hi>the day of the Lord Jeſus,</hi> as alſo <hi>the Day of the Lord,</hi> and <hi>the day of God.</hi> As it ſhall be the Day of the Lord Jeſus, it ſhall alſo be our Day, therefore St. <hi>Paul</hi> calls it, <hi>The day of our Redemption,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that in this day, our Lord ſhall redeem our Bodies out of their Graves, and ſhall beſtow upon, both our Souls and Bodies, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. all the Fruits of that Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which he hath purchaſed for us with his Blood, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. and ſhall raiſe us up to the higheſt Glory, and moſt perfect happineſs, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9 It is the happy Day of the Conſummation of our Marriage with this Divine Lamb. It is the day of our Joy and Triumph, with the glorified Men and Angels. It is the day of our Coronation, and of our entrance into our Kingdom, when the King of Kings,
<pb n="544" facs="tcp:41646:276" rendition="simple:additions"/>the Lord of Lords ſhall Crown us with his own hand, and put us in poſſeſſion of an Empire prepared for us from the beginning of the World. In a word, it is the day when we ſhall come to the Lord Jeſus and be with him, as he is with the Father, that we may be all in one.</p>
            <p>Becauſe of the glorious and wonderful things which ſhall come to paſs on this day, it is named <hi>The great Day,</hi> St. <hi>Jude</hi> calls it thus, when he ſpeaks of the Revolted Angels, he ſaith, <hi>That God hath reſerved them in everlaſting Chains un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der darkneſs, unto the Judgment of the Great Day.</hi> In this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner many underſtand the words of St. <hi>John,</hi> when he deſcribes the Foul Spirits, and likens them to Frogs, which he ſaw coming out of the Dragons Mouth, and of the Beaſt, and out of the Mouth of the Falſe Prophet, and ſaith, <hi>They are the Spirits of Devils working Miracles, which God ſent forth unto the Kings of the Earth, and of the whole World, to gather them to the Battle of that great Day of God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty,</hi> Revel. 16.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, this glorious Day is not only called <hi>The day of Judgement, the Day of the Lord, the Day of our Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the Great day,</hi> but oftimes without any addition, it is ſtiled <hi>the Day, and that Day,</hi> as in the 10. Chap. to the <hi>Hebrews, Let us conſider one another to provoke unto Love and good Works, not forſaking the aſſembling our ſelves to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, as the manner of ſome is, but exhorting one another, and ſo much the more as ye ſee the day approaching.</hi> In the firſt Epiſt. to the <hi>Theſſal. You are not in Darkneſs, that that Day ſhould ſurpriſe you.</hi> Thus in 2 Epiſt. to <hi>Timothy,</hi> and firſt Chap. St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>I know whom I have belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and I am perſwaded that he is able to keep that, which I have committed unto him againſt that Day.</hi> And when he remembers the good and charitable Deeds of <hi>Meſiphorus,</hi> he prays for him in this manner, <hi>The Lord grant unto him, that he may find Mercy of the Lord in that day;</hi> And in the 4 Chap. ſpeaking of himſelf he ſaith, <hi>I have fought the good fight, I have finiſhed my courſe, I have kept the Faith, henceforth there is laid up for me a Crown of Righteouſneſs,
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:41646:276" rendition="simple:additions"/>which the Lord the righteous Judge ſhall give at that Day.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is ſo ſtiled, becauſe of its excellency, it is the Day of Dayes, the end of all the Seaſons, the Conſummation of all Ages and Times, after this there ſhall be no more al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration of Days, Months, and Years. Therefore an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel is repreſented in the <hi>Revel.</hi> lifting up his hand to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, ſwearing by the living God, who hath Created Heaven and all things therein, the Earth and all things in it, and the Sea, and the things that are there. That there ſhall be no more Time; for inſtead of this unconſtant time which flies away, without leaving any ſign of its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an everlaſting Eternity, ſhall ſucceed an Eternity al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways the ſame, always Bleſſed with Happineſs, alwayes glorious and joyful. This Divine and Magnificent Day ſhall begin at the end of all other Days, but ſhall never draw to an end. Therefore St. <hi>Peter</hi> in theſe words, calls it an Eternal day or Eternity, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. <hi>Glory be to the Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, both now and for ever,</hi> Amen. And in expectation of this Day of Days, all Creatures are groaning and travailling in pain until now, but eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially Believers, who have the Firſt Fruits of the Spirit, groan in themſelves, deſiring with an earneſt and holy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, to ſee the breaking of this great and glorious Day. It is the end of all the Prophecies, and the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all Gods gracious promiſes to his People in all the Ages of the World. It is the end and price of our Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Calling, the fulfilling of all our deſires and expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, the Crowning of all our Labors, and the higheſt ſtep of that glory and happineſs, unto which we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend.</p>
            <p>You, <hi>Devout Souls,</hi> that delight in the contemplation of Celeſtial things, I pray conſider with me, the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and the perfection of three kinds of works, which have been ſucceeded by their ſeveral Reſts. The firſt was that of the Creation of the World, for in ſix days God Created the Heaven and the Earth, and all things in them, and when he had finiſhed his Works, and found
<pb n="546" facs="tcp:41646:277" rendition="simple:additions"/>that they were good and perfect, he reſted the ſeventh day, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. <hi>&amp;</hi> 2. Therefore he Bleſſed and Sanctified it. The ſecond great work was that of Redemption, for when our Saviour had fulfilled all the Propheſies which me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned him, when he had cauſed the meaning of all the ancient Types and Figures to appear in his perſon, and in his ſufferings, when he had fully ſatisfied the juſtice of God, and purchaſed for us with his Blood, an Eternal Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he cried out, <hi>all is finiſhed, John</hi> 19. and he bowed his Head, and gave up the Ghoſt. After this, Chriſt had nothing more to do, nor to ſuffer, but he is gone into Heaven to Reſt from all his Works, <hi>Revel.</hi> 5. and to take poſſeſſion of all power, riches, wiſdom, ſtrength, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, glory, and praiſe. The third Work is that of our Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rification, when we ſhall ſee new Heavens appear, and a new Earth, when our Bodies ſhall be cloathed with Incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption and Immortality, and united again to our Souls, and when in both Soul and Body we ſhall attain to the higheſt glory, and moſt perfect happineſs. Then he that ſits upon the Throne of Eternity ſhall ſay with a loud voice, <hi>Revel.</hi> 21. <hi>All is finiſhed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Afterwards the Sabbath of Sabbaths ſhall ſucceed that Eternal reſt and that peace, which ſhall never be interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by any unhappineſs. We may ſay, that the firſt reſt is that of God the Father, the ſecond belongs to the Son, the third is the reſt of the Holy Ghoſt, that ſhall have then gathered all the Saints together, reared up the Houſe of God to the roof, and perfectly enlightened and ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied the Catholick Church, from whence ſhall proceed its Eternal Glory and Happineſs; or rather, we may ſay, that this laſt reſt, is the reſt of all the Three Perſons, of the moſt holy and moſt glorious Trinity, for then they ſhall reſt from all manner of Works for ever and ever, and we in the boſome of their Glory; we ſhall alſo enjoy an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting teſt. When the Works of Creation were finiſhed, the Works of Redemption were next expected, and after the Works of Redemption, we hope for the Works of our

There ſhall be no more Tears to be wiped, no more evils to be feared, nor advantages to be expected, not Crowns to receive, for then all the Children of God ſhall be perfectly glorified.

            <p>
               <hi>Abraham</hi> leaped for joy, when he ſaw the Birth day and humiliation of the Son of God, how ſhould we rejoyce and be tranſported out of our ſelves, when we think upon this glorious Day of the appearing of our Great God and Saviour? when with the eye of Faith we behold him ſitting upon the Clouds of Heaven, coming to put a period to Sin and Death, to ſhut up the Devil and his Angels in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomleſs pit of Hell, to deliver his Church from all Evils, Enemies, and Dangers, and to promote it to the higheſt felicity, and to an everlaſting glory?</p>
            <p>After this, <hi>Believing Souls,</hi> I muſt draw the curtain, and ſuffer my pen to fall from my hand, for mine eyes dazle at the ſight of ſo much light, and my Soul is ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed at the conſideration of ſo much glory and ſo perfect an happineſs.</p>
            <p>Although I have continued in this Treatiſe longer then I firſt propoſed to my ſelf, I muſt needs confeſs, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever I have ſaid upon ſo rich and glorious a ſubject, falls far ſhort of the Truth. But I am perſwaded, that there ſhall be here enough, for pious and devout Souls,
<pb n="548" facs="tcp:41646:278" rendition="simple:additions"/>that ſeek not for the ornaments of Language, nor for the flouriſhes of Rhetorick, but ſeek for the true and ſolid comforts of Gods holy Word. You <hi>Chriſtian</hi> and <hi>Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving</hi> Souls, for whoſe ſakes I have undertaken this Work, I intreat you by the Glory of God, and by your own Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, to preſerve in your minds the <hi>Ideas</hi> of theſe things, that I have now ſpoken of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Imprint them in your Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, grave them upon your Hearts, with the point of a Diamond, and eſpecially take delight in following my di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, and you ſhall aſſuredly find both joy and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort. Think often upon Death, let it be the moſt familiar and moſt pleaſant ſubject of your Diſcourſe, expect it at every Moment, and lead ſuch a Life, as if Death were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready upon your Lips. Fear not the many troubles of this humane Life, doubt not, but that God hath determined the time and manner of your going out of the World, and that every kind of Death of the Children of God is precious in his ſight. Seeing that you are to live yet but a moment here upon Earth, ſettle not here your Hearts, but injoy your Riches and advantages, as not enjoying them, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring that the faſhion of this World paſſeth away; ſeeing that it is Sin alone, that makes Death appear ſo terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to us, hate all manner of Vice, and ſtudy the practice of Piety.</p>
            <p>And ſeeing that there is no body at the hour of Death, but wiſheth that he had lived well; think upon your latter end, and you ſhall never be able to Sin. If your mind is diſturbed with the conſideration of thoſe things, which ſhall happen after our Deceaſe, learn to reſt upon the wiſe Providence of God, that ſees into the depths of Eternity, that provides for all things, and that draws Light out of the greateſt Darkneſs. Are you caſt upon a Bed of Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Diſeaſe, open the eye of Faith, and you ſhall ſee your ſelves encompaſſed about with holy Angels, and in the Arms of God himſelf; dread not the violence of pain, for God ſhall never forſake you in your grief, he ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſuffer you to be afflicted, above what you are able to
<pb n="549" facs="tcp:41646:278" rendition="simple:additions"/>indure; fancy him not as a dreadful and a mercileſs Judge, but look upon him as a gracious and a loving Father, who deſires not the Death of a Sinner, but rather that he ſhould repent and live. If Death appears to you with a frightful Countenance, if it fills you full of Terror, caſt your eyes by Faith upon the Croſs of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and you ſhall ſee there, all the Weapons and Armour of this Death broken in pieces. You ſhall ſee there a Divine and precious<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Blood running down, which hath ſatisfied for all your Sins, and marked unto you the way to Gods Eternal Sanctuary. Let not the Grave that is digging for you, terrify you, ſeeing that the King of Kings hath been laid there before you, and filled it with his moſt Divine Perfumes. Let Death ſeem to you never ſo Dreadful, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that our Saviour hath overcome it by his Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, fear not therefore to incounter it, ſeeing that our Great God and Saviour ſhall make you partaker of his Victory. And that you might beget in your Souls an ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt longing to go to Heaven. Look upon Jeſus Chriſt there, who prepares a place for you, and deſires that you ſhould be eternally with him, to behold his Joy and Glory. Fear not the ſeparation of the Soul from the Body, ſeeing that Death which ſhall ſeparate you from your ſelves, is not able to ſeparate you from the Spirit of the Lord Jeſus. The Soul of our Souls, the Seal of the promiſes of God, and the earneſt of our future Inheritance. Inſtead of looking backwards, and longing for theſe periſhing advantages, and for Honors that can only dazle the eye; conſider that Death ſhall wipe away all Tears, remove all your grief, and raiſe you above all the ſtorms of the World, above all the miſeries and troubles that cover the face of the Earth. That you may be able to follow this Death more chearfully. Remember that it draws you out of a place all polluted with Sin, and infected with Impiety, to tranſport you into a new Heaven, adorned with Righteouſneſs and Holineſs, and perfumed with the Prayers, Praiſes, and Thankſgivings of the Glorified Saints; remember that it frees you from
<pb n="550" facs="tcp:41646:279" rendition="simple:additions"/>all remains of corruption, and gives Deaths wound to all your Luſts. Mind not ſo much the falſe appearance of Death, for to the wicked it is as it were the Subburbs of Hell, the jaws of the bottomleſs pit, and the beginning of their endleſs Torments; but to you <hi>Believers,</hi> it is the Gate of Heaven, an entrance into Paradice, and a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage to a moſt happy Life Learn to reliſh now the Joys wherewith your Souls ſhall be for ever ſatisfied, when God ſhall Crown you with his Glory, and make you Drink of the Rivers of his Pleaſure. Seeing that your Soul is going to put on a Garment of an Immortal colour, and to dwell for ever in the Palace which God hath built with his Almighty hand. Caſt off willingly this wretched, craſie, and corruptible Body; depart willingly out of this Earthly Tabernacle, which turns of it ſelf into Duſt. Conſider well, that if it falls by Death, it ſhall riſe again at the Reſurrection, and that when it ſhall have been the Dwelling and the Food of Worms, it ſhall at laſt become the Temple of God, and the Tabernacle of his Glory. Finally, O Religious Souls, ſhut your eyes to the World, and to all the vanities in it, which the World adores, and aſpire to the real advantages which God hath prepared for you, before the Creation of the World, and which you ſhall injoy, when the World ſhall be no more. Let your precious Faith, and your bleſſed hope, enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Eternity it ſelf, to behold that extraordinary happineſs and glory which God ſhall accompliſh, when he ſhall bring us both in Soul and Body, into his Celeſtial Paradice, to ſee his face, in which is fulneſs of Joy.</p>
            <p>Seeing that this perfect happineſs, and infinite Glory, which never entered into the Heart and thoughts of Man, ſhall never be perfectly accompliſhed; but at that Day when Jeſus Chriſt ſhall appear from Heaven, to be glorified in his Saints, and to become wonderful in all Believers; Think alwayes upon this Glorious Day, the end of all our wiſhes, the fulfilling of all your hopes, and the perfection of all the deſignes which God hath conceived in himſelf from all Eternity.</p>

               <p>O <hi>Great Judge of the World, bottomleſs Fountain of Life and happineſs, thy Gracious hand hath put into mine Heart, the ſeeds of Immortality, the firſt-fruits of Heavens Glory, and the foretaſts of everlaſting Delights. Thou haſt made me to behold by Faith, the joys and happineſs of Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, where thou ſhalt receive my Soul when it ſhall depart out of this wretched World, and to Meditate upon the Glory which thou prepareſt for my Body, when thou ſhalt take it to thy ſelf, to make it like to thy Glorious Body. Now raiſe my

Let me ſometime conſider that glorious Throne, where thou ſhalt ſit to judge the quick and the dead, before which the greateſt Princes, Kings, and Monarchs, as well as the vileſt Servants, Subjects, and Slaves; and generally all the Men of the World ſhall appear to receive in their Bodies, according as they have done, whether it be good or evil. O that I might rejoyce in an expectation of ſeeing the total and intire deſtruction of all the Enemies of thy Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and of our Salvation. That I might look upon</hi> Satan <hi>his wicked Angels, his Agents, and the inſtruments of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, at if they were already bound up in everlaſting Chains, caſt into the Lake of fire and brimſtone, and ſhut up in that bottomleſs pit, from whence they ſhall never be releaſed. That I might think upon that Bleſſed time, when Death ſhall be no more, when all the living ſhall be Immortal; but chiefly give me Grace to behold with the eye of that precious Faith which thou haſt formed in my Soul, the joy and Coronation of thy Church, to conſider that Divine dwelling, where the ſtately and moſt magnificent City is built, with pure Gold, Pearles, and Precious Stones, where thou thy ſelf art the Light and the Sun, where the uncorruptible inheritance is, which cannot be defiled and cannot fade away, where the River of living wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter runs, which is as bright as Chryſtal, where the Tree of Life is, which yields fruit every Month of the year, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the Leaves are for healing of the Gentiles.

O Lord give us Grace to think continually upon his glorious and joyful day, which ſhall put a period to the current of time, which is the accompliſhment of all the Prophecies and Promiſes, the body and reallity of all types and figures, the Crowning of all our Works, the fulfilling of all our deſires, the higheſt of all our hopes, and the perfection of all the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns intended by God the Father from all Eternity.
